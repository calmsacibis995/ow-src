Function Keys Panel/Virtual Keyboard

1. Using the Function Keys Panel

The Function Keys Panel is a pop-up window that
is displayed at the bottom of the screen when you
select "Function Keys" from the Workspace menu's
Utilities submenu.  

The Function Keys Panel is equivalent to the
function keys on your keyboard. Applications use
it to provide application-specific labels for the
function keys.

When you change the input area to a window that
uses the function keys, the key labels in the
Function Keys Panel are automatically updated to
reflect the new set of function key actions. When
you change the input area to a window that does
not use the function keys, the key labels are
left blank.

You can also use the keys in the Function Keys
Panel to activate the functions (assuming you
have the Workspace property "Set Input Area" set
to "Click SELECT"): just click SELECT on a key.


2. Using the Virtual Keyboard

Multiple language support is provided by the
Virtual Keyboard available through the LANGUAGE
key, which is R2 (PrSc) by default. 

When you press and hold the LANGUAGE key, the 
Character Sets Window is displayed, showing keys
that correspond to the top row of the function
keys. Labels for these function keys correspond
to character sets for different languages.

Pressing the More function key changes the
labels of the keycaps in the panel, cycling
through the set of available character sets.

Pressing Show opens the Virtual Keyboard
Window, which displays the entire keyboard with
the corresponding characters for the currently 
active character set.

While you press the LANGUAGE key, the chosen
language is bound to the keyboard, and the
corresponding key labels are displayed in the
Virtual Keyboard Window (if it is open). In this
way, you can easily access a few characters or
symbols from another language or alternate
character set interactively, and then return to
typing with your usual character set.

For example, to type a few Greek characters in
English text, hold down the LANGUAGE key, press
the Greek key, and then type some characters.
When you release the LANGUAGE key, the Character
Sets window is dismissed and the primary character
set is restored to English.

You can also use the keys in the Virtual Keyboard
Window to type characters (assuming you have the
Workspace property "Set Input Area" set to "Click
SELECT"): just click SELECT on a key.

Pressing the Set key redefines the keyboard to
make it correspond to the currently selected
character set. When you release the LANGUAGE key,
the Character Sets Window is dismissed. 

For example, to change the keyboard character set
from English to Greek, hold down the LANGUAGE
key, press the Greek key, and then press the Set
key. When you release the LANGUAGE key, the
Character Sets Window is dismissed and the
default character set is Greek. Any alphabetic key
you press on the keyboard types the corresponding
Greek character at the active text insert point.

If you do not press the Set key, the default
character set is not changed when the LANGUAGE
key is released.

If you do not know which keys correspond to the
characters for the language  you have selected,
press the LANGUAGE key and the Show key: the
Virtual Keyboard Window is displayed or updated
with the appropriate labels on the keycaps.

This window remains on the screen when you 
release the LANGUAGE key, and it can be 
closed to an icon or dismissed separately.
