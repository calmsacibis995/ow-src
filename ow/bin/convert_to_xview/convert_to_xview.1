convert_to_xview(1)              USER COMMAND       convert_to_xview(1)

NAME
     convert_to_xview - convert a SunView1 source program to XView source

SYNOPSIS
     convert_to_xview [-m] filename...

AVAILABILITY
     This command is available with the XView software distribution.

DESCRIPTION
     convert_to_xview is a shell script which uses sed(1) scripts 
     to convert SunView1.x programs to the XView Application
     Programming Interface (API).  convert_to_xview parses "filename"
     and creates a new file with the XView API in the current directory
     called "filename".converted_to_xview.

     The standard conversion that is done is called FULL conversion.
     FULL conversion of SunView1 source converts everything to XView
     naming conventions reguardless of API compatibility support (eg.
     changes WIN_FONT to XV_FONT even though WIN_FONT would still
     work).
     
     The other type of conversion is called MINIMAL conversion.
     MINIMAL conversion retains SunView1 compatibility wherever
     possible and inserts a unique "flag" and comments at every
     instance where manual conversion is necessary in C language source
     comment form.  The flag and comments will look something like
     this:
     
     	/* XView CONVERSION - use xv_set() instead. See Sect 3.2 */

     The original SunView1.x file is not modified.
     
     After the file is converted, you should then search for 
     
     		XView CONVERSION
    
     in the new converted program (filename.converted_to_xview).  Use
     the conversion documentation, "XView Reference Manual: Converting
     SunView1 to XView," to determine the proper conversion for these
     "flagged" items.  In some possible cases, the comments may make
     references to sections in the manual which should be consulted to
     correctly convert something.
     
OPTIONS

     -m   Perform minimal conversion only. 
     

ENVIRONMENT
     The script assumes that the necessary sed(1) conversion scripts
     are located in the standard XView binary installation directory.
     By default XView would be installed into /usr.  If XView were
     installed into a different directory, for example /home/xview,
     $OPENWINHOME should be set to /home/xview/usr because the sed
     scripts would have been installed into /home/xview/usr/bin/xview.
     
     convert_to_xview will assume that $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview is in
     the standard $PATH environment variable if $OPENWINHOME isn't
     set.
     
EXAMPLES
     Convert my_program.c from SunView1 to XView:

          % convert_to_xview my_program.c
          ----Converting file: foo.c
          --Done
          %

     Now go in and edit (with your favorite text editor such as vi,
     textedit, etc) the result of the conversion
     (my_program.c.converted_to_xview) and see if there is anything
     that didn't get converted:
     
          % textedit my_program.c.converted

     Do only mininal conversion of my_program.c & your_program.c to XView:

          % convert_to_xview -m my_program.c your_program.c
          ----Converting file: foo.c
          ----Converting file: blah.c
          --Done
          %

     The above would create two files new files and each will only
     had mininal conversion performed (just flags inserted).

FILES
     $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview/convert_to_xview
     $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview/.*.sed       (full & minimal conversion scripts)
     
     Where $OPENWINHOME is the installation point for OpenWindows.
