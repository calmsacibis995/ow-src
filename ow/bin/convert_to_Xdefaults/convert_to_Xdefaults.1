convert_to_Xdefaults(1)              USER COMMAND      convert_to_Xdefaults(1)

NAME
     convert_to_Xdefaults - converts a SunView defaults file to Xdefaults format

SYNOPSIS
     convert_to_Xdefaults filename

AVAILABILITY
     This command is available with the XView software distribution.

DESCRIPTION
     convert_to_Xdefaults is a shell script which uses sed(1) scripts 
     to convert SunView defaults to X Window (Xdefaults) defaults.  
     convert_to_xview reads "filename" scanning for SunView defaults
     and converts them to their equivalent Xdefaults for XView.  Defaults
     that are no longer supported or are not recognized as standard
     SunView defaults are commented out with a '!' (exclamation-point) at
     the beginnning of the default entry.  The output of conversion
     is directed to standard output (stdout).  The default name for
     your "defaults" file for XView should be ".Xdefaults" and should
     be located in your $HOME directory.
     
     SAMPLES:
     
     A SunView1 defaults entries ...
	
	/Text/Auto_indent       	"True"
	/Text/Extras_menu_filename      "/home/blinky/bob/.text_extras_menu"
	/Scrollbar/Thickness		"20"
	/Mail/Set/folder		"/home/blinky/bob/mail_folder"
	/Text/Multi_click_timeout	"100"
	
     ...is converted to the Xdefault...
     
        Text.AutoIndent:        	True
        Text.ExtrasMenuFilename:        /home/blinky/bob/.text_extras_menu
        !/Scrollbar/Thickness		"20"
        !/Mail/Set/folder		"/home/blinky/bob/mail_folder"
        !OpenWindows.MultiClickTimeout:(now in tenths of seconds rather than millisecs)  100


     Note that the /Scrollbar/Thickness and /Mail/Set/folder entries
     were NOT converted (a '! was inserted to comment them out).  These
     entries should be removed from your Xdefaults since they are not
     read and are not valid. However, notice that 
     /Text/Multi_click_timeout was converted to 
     OpenWindows.MultiClickTimeout but is commented out.  The comment
     after the '!' ("now in tenths of seconds") instructes you that
     the value of this entry is now in tenths of seconds.  You should
     apply the needed change to the value and remove both the comments
     and the '!'.
     
EXAMPLES 

     Run the script on you SunView1 defaults file...

	% convert_to_Xdefaults $HOME/.defaults > $HOME/.Xdefaults

     Now go in and edit the resulting file (output of conversion now
     in $HOME/.Xdefaults) and remove any unconverted entries or
     make modifications described in comments inserted and then
     remove the comments and the '!'.     
     
FILES
