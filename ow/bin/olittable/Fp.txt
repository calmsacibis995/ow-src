DESCRIPTION

	The FooterPanel widget is a simple composite widget that provides a consistent 
	interface for attaching a footer message to the bottom of a base window.
	
	The FooterPanel widget is comprised of 3 widget components:
		footerpanel		(created automatically)
		topchild		(created by application as child of footerpanel)
		footerchild		(created by application as child of footerpanel)

	The first widget created as a child of the footerpanel is the topchild, the
	second becomes the footerchild.

	The FooterPanel widget attempts to let its children grow/shrink to any
	size.  However, if the FooterPanel is resized smaller, it sets both children
	to its width but imposes all height restriction on the topchild (thus, the
	bottom child remains the same height).  If the FooterPanel is resized larger,
	it sets both children to its width and gives all height increase to the topchild
	(again the bottomchild remains the same height). The intent is to essentially
	allow the footerchild to float at the bottom of the base window.

 	For more detailed information on the FooterPanel Widget, see the following
	Sections in the OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit Widget Set Reference Manual:
		. FooterPanel


EXAMPLE CODE

The following function could be used to Create the example FooterPanel Widget shown 
in the Table (All color specific code has been removed for simplification):
