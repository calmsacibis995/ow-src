The following shows the procedure/steps for performing source product 
build:

(All throughout the documentation, directory path and release names 
used here are examples)


FOR TESTING:
==============

- On sparc, create the sparc source trees

  # 	cd <sparc-build-dir>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/buildSourceTrees.prl <dest-dir> <release-name>

- On x86, create the x86 source trees

  # 	cd <x86-build-dir>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/buildSourceTrees.prl <dest-dir> <release-name>


- On ppc, create the ppc source trees

  # 	cd <ppc-build-dir>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/buildSourceTrees.prl <dest-dir> <release-name>

On all platforms, do the following steps:

- Set the /usr/openwin as a symbolic link to the new build
  s<XXX>{s,x,p}-<release-name>


- start building on all platforms

  #	cd <dest-dir>/SOURCE_TEST_S<XXX>_<release-name>
  #	./buildit &

  NOTE: This version of buildit is slightly different than the one
	used by internal RE because this version is tailored for customer's 
	environment.

- if build completes cleanly, make the packages by:

  #	cd <dest-dir>/SOURCE_TEST_S<XXX>_<release-name>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/make_release_packages <package-name>

  NOTE: This version of make_release_packages is slightly different than the one
	used by internal RE because this version is tailored for customer's 
	environment.

- Install and test builds

- Check Documentation


FOR SHIPPING:
==============

On sparc machine:

- Create clean source trees AGAIN using buildSourceTrees.prl:
  
  # 	cd <sparc-build-dir>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/buildSourceTrees.prl <dest-dir> <release-name>


- Copy over from the x86 and ppc specific files:

  #	cd <sparc-build-dir>
  #	proto-tool-Obj-*-svr4/copy_arch_spec_files <dest-dir> <release-name>


- Copy over the build log file for the customer from the test source 
  tree that you just performed test build into this directory in the 
  clean source trees:

  /SOURCE+SCCS_S<XXX>_<release-name>/doc/buildit-OL-$ARCH-svr4.log 

  /SOURCE_TEST_S<XXX>_<release-name>/doc/buildit-OL-$ARCH-svr4.log 


- Compress the clean source trees:

(commands for SCCS History Source Tree, includes charon deliver)
% cd SOURCE+SCCS_S<XXX>_<release-name>
% find . -depth -print | cpio -oc > sccs_<consolidation>
% compress sccs_<consolidation>
% deliver -s -h rat -r s<XXX>_source_beta sccs_<consolidation>.Z

(commands for Clear Text Source Tree, includes charon deliver)
% cd SOURCE_TEST_S<XXX>_<release-name>
% find . -depth -print | cpio -oc > clear_<consolidation>
% compress clear_<consolidation>
% deliver -s -h rat -r s<XXX>_source_beta clear_<consolidation>.Z
