.SH NAME
answerbook \- browse, search, and view on-line documentation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B answerbook
[
.I navigator-options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B answerbook
starts up
.BR navigator (1)
(the AnswerBook Navigator window) on the OpenWindows desktop
after performing several tasks to initialize the AnswerBook environment.
These tasks are important to the proper functioning of the AnswerBook
software, so
.B navigator
should always be invoked via
.B answerbook,
rather than invoked directly by the user.
.LP
.B answerbook
performs the following functions each time it runs:
.TP
.B Verify OpenWindows environment
Makes sure that $OPENWINHOME is set, that the correct version of OpenWindows
(version 3.3 or greater) is running, etc.
.TP
.B Source answerbook_setup
If there is an executable sh or ksh shell script called "answerbook_setup"
in the user's search path, source it.  Typically, this file would contain
shell commands that enable access to shared AnswerBooks available
on the network.  See the "AnswerBook Administration" guide for more information
on sharing AnswerBooks on a network.
.TP
.B Find locally installed AnswerBooks
If there are any AnswerBooks installed on the local machine, find them (using
.BR pkginfo (1)
) and make them available to the current AnswerBook session.
.TP
.B Verify AnswerBooks present
Make sure there is at least one AnswerBook available to the user in the
current AnswerBook session.  If not, print an error message and exit.
.TP
.B Create Personal Library
For first-time AnswerBook users, create a personal AnswerBook library file
($HOME/.ab_library) that includes all the currently accessible AnswerBooks.
See
.BR ab_library (4)
for more information.
.TP
.B Start AnswerBook Navigator
Invoke
.BR navigator (1),
passing on any command line options with which it was invoked.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.B answerbook
passes all command line options on to
.BR navigator (1).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B AB_CARDCATALOG
.B answerbook
makes locally installed AnswerBooks accessible by appending their card
catalog file names to the this environment variable, which
.B navigator
uses in assembling its list of available AnswerBooks.  See
.BR ab_cardcatalog (4)
for more information.
.TP
.B OPENWINHOME
This environment variable must be set appropriately.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B $HOME/.ab_cardcatalog
Personal card catalog file.
.TP
.B $HOME/.ab_library
Default AnswerBook library file.  Created automatically by
.B answerbook
for first-time AnswerBook users.
.TP
.B answerbook_setup
Shell script containing AnswerBook setup commands, typically for
enabling access to shared AnswerBooks on the network.  If there is a file
by this name in the user's search path,
.B answerbook
sources it.
.TP
.B /tmp/ab_cardcatalog.*
Temporary card catalog file occasionally generated by
.B answerbook
to facilitate access to locally installed AnswerBooks.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
If
.B answerbook
finds no AnswerBooks during the initialization process, 
it prints a message to the console and exits without starting up the
AnswerBook Navigator.
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR docviewer (1),

.SH NOTES
.LP
Pre-Solaris 2.2 AnswerBooks come with
.B answerbook
scripts of their own that are customized for that particular AnswerBook.
These scripts do not work under OpenWindows 3.2, and are obviated by the new
.B answerbook
script.
