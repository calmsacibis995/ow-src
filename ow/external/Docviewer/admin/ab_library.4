.SH NAME
ab_library \- collection of AnswerBooks browsed and searched as a unit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B $HOME/.ab_library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
An AnswerBook library is a group of AnswerBooks that can be
browsed and searched as a unit by
.BR navigator (1)
(the AnswerBook Navigator).
Also included in a library is the list of bookmarks referencing that
library's AnswerBooks.
.LP
The default library file is
.B $HOME/.ab_library
.LP
.B navigator
automatically creates a new library for the user if one does not already
exist.
Whenever the AnswerBook user adds or deletes an AnswerBook to the library
via the
.B navigator
"Modify Library" pop-up window,
.B navigator
saves those changes to the library file so that they exist between
AnswerBook sessions.
Changes to the library's bookmark list are similarly saved.
.LP
The AnswerBook library file is created and maintained solely by the
AnswerBook Navigator.  It is not intended to be hand-editable.
.LP
.B navigator
employs a library file locking mechanism to prevent data loss or corruption
when multiple Navigator access the same library file simultaneously.
The Navigator creates a lock file (
.B ab_library.lock
).  If a lock file already exists,
the Navigator informs the user that the file is locked,
then asks whether the user wants to 1) quit, 2) access
the library in read-only mode, or 3) override the lock.
Locks should only be overridden when they are known to be out of date,
i.e., the program that created the lock is no longer running.
The Navigator removes the lock file it created upon exiting.
