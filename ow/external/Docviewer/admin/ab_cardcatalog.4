.SH NAME
ab_cardcatalog \- directory of available AnswerBooks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B $HOME/.ab_cardcatalog, $AB_CARDCATALOG
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
AnswerBook card catalogs serve as directories for listing and locating AnswerBooks on the local system and on
the network.  The AnswerBook programs
.BR navigator (1),
.BR docviewer (1),
and others depend on card catalogs to list and find all available AnswerBooks.
.LP
A card catalog file contains entries for one or more AnswerBooks.  Each entry provides information on the AnswerBook's title, id, version number, and the location of its component files.
.LP
Use the
.BR ab_admin (1)
utility to add, delete, modify, or query AnswerBook entries in a card catalog file.
Card catalog files are not intended for hand-editing, though they are ASCII files.
.LP
AnswerBook programs that use card catalogs typically consult
several of them, if necessary, in order to locate the entry for a given AnswerBook.
In particular:
.RS
.TP 26
.B $HOME/.ab_cardcatalog
entries for personal AnswerBooks
.TP 26
.B $AB_CARDCATALOG
shared, network-wide AnswerBooks
.RE
.LP
When an AnswerBook package is installed on a machine, the installation
software will create a separate card catalog file for that particular
AnswerBook.
If that AnswerBook is to be shared among users in a network, its
card catalog entry should be added to the network-wide card catalog file
so that it will be generally available.  See
.BR ab_admin (1)
or the
.TZ ABADMIN
for more information on sharing AnswerBooks on the network.
.SH FORMAT
.LP
Each AnswerBook entry in a card catalog file contains the following fields:
.RS 
.TP 12
.B title
AnswerBook title
.TP
.B id
AnswerBook id
.TP
.B version
AnswerBook version number (optional)
.TP
.B pspath
Full path name of directory containing AnswerBook's PostScript files
.TP
.B tocpath
Full path name of directory containing AnswerBook's Table of Contents databases
.TP
.B indexpath
Full path name of directory containing search index files
.RE
.LP
The "version" field is optional and serves mainly to distinguish two
AnswerBooks that have the same id but different content.
All other fields are mandatory
.LP
The format of an entry is a set of colon-separated "field name=value" pairs.
Entries can span more than one line by terminating each line with a backslash
character ('\\').
Blank lines and comment lines (those beginning with '#') are ignored.
.LP
The first line of a card catalog file must be the string
.RS
.sp
\f3#<Card Catalog> version 1\f1
.sp
.RE
which is the "magic number" for card catalog files.  See
.BR binder (1)
for more information on magic numbers.
.LP
Here is a sample card catalog file:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\f3#<Card Catalog> version 1

#
# Sample card catalog entry for My AnswerBook
#
title=Title of My AnswerBook: \\
id=MyAB: \\
pspath=/net/my_server/export/AnswerBooks/MyAB/ps: \\

.SH NOTES
.LP
Pre-Solaris 2.2 AnswerBooks use the old-style "bookinfo" mechanism,
which has been superseded by card catalogs.  The bookinfo files for
these AnswerBooks should be converted to card catalog files using
.BR ab_admin (1)
in order to work in OpenWindows Version 3.2 or higher.
