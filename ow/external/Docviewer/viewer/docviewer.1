.SH DESCRIPTION
.B docviewer
and 
.BR navigator (1)
constitute an OpenWindows
application for viewing and navigating
AnswerBook on-line document collections.
.LP
.B docviewer
displays PostScript files found using
.B navigator.
.B docviewer
lets you page through a document, print pages, magnify or reduce pages,
and follow hypertext links and cross-references to other documents.
.LP
You should not start
.B docviewer
directly.
It is started automatically by
.B navigator
as needed.
If you are running several navigators simultaneously,
they will each start their own docviewers.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP

accepts most of the generic tool arguments described in
.BR xview (7),
as well as the following options:
.TP
.B \-d \f2document-name\fP
Specify the name of the document to be viewed.
.TP
.B \-c \f2card-catalog\fP

.SH USAGE
.LP
Once a document is displayed in the
.B docviewer
window, you can view it as follows:
.TP
.B Page Turning
Click SELECT on the left and right arrow buttons at the top of the
.B docviewer
window to page back and forth through a document.
The PgUp and PgDn keys on the keyboard perform the same functions.
In addition, the Home and End keys
let you page through a document one chapter at a time.
.TP
.B Page History
.B docviewer
keeps track of each page visited. 
Click SELECT on the Go Back button until the window returns
to the page you want to revisit, or use the Undo keyboard function.
.TP
.B Hypertext Links 
.B docviewer
has a simple hypertext mechanism. Hypertext links are displayed
as rectangular outlines around words or graphics on a page.
Double-clicking SELECT on a link causes
.B docviewer
to display the document and page to which the link points.
Documents may have links to other documents within the same 
collection.
Certain types of hypertext links can also initiate system processes.
Double-clicking on these links will start up a program or shell script.
.TP
.B Page Magnification
Magnify or reduce the size of the document by pulling the resize corners on the
.B docviewer
window, or select the "View->Custom Magnification" menu item.
Select the "View->Standard Magnification" menu item to reset the document
to the standard size.
For very high magnifications, select the "View->Partial Page" menu item
so that the
.B docviewer
window still fits on the screen.
.TP
.B Printing
Click SELECT on the Print button to show the pop-up Print Window.
In the Print Window, select the page or document to print,
number of copies, and printing device (or file).

describing the chapter, book, and AnswerBook you are currently viewing.
