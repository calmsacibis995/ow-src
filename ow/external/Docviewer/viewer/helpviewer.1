.SH NAME
helpviewer \- OpenWindows viewer for on-line help handbooks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B helpviewer
.B \-f
.I help-handbook-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B helpviewer
is an OpenWindows application for viewing and navigating on-line help
handbooks.
.LP
.B helpviewer
lets you page through a help handbook, magnify or reduce pages,
and follow hypertext links and table-of-contents entries within
a handbook and to other handbooks.
Because help handbooks are in PostScript format, they may contain high
quality fonts and graphics.
.LP
You should not start
.B helpviewer
directly.  It is started automatically by OpenWindows when you click SELECT
on the "More" button in a spot help window, or when you select the "Help..."
item in the OpenWindows root menu.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.B helpviewer
accepts most of the generic tool arguments described in
.BR xview (7),
as well as the following options:
.TP
.B \-f \f2help-handbook-file\fP
Specify the name of the help handbook to be viewed.  This file name
should be specified relative to a directory in $HELPPATH
(see ENVIRONMENT below).
.SH USAGE
.LP
Once a help handbook is displayed in the
.B helpviewer
window, you can view it as follows:
.TP
.B Page Turning
Click SELECT on the left and right arrow buttons at the top of the
.B helpviewer
window to page back and forth through a handbook.
The PgUp and PgDn keys on the keyboard perform the same functions.
In addition, the Home and End keys
let you page through a handbook one chapter at a time.
.TP
.B Page History
.B helpviewer
keeps track of each page visited. 
Click SELECT on the Go Back button until the window returns
to the page you want to revisit, or use the Undo keyboard function.
.TP
.B Hypertext Links 
.B helpviewer
has a simple hypertext mechanism. Hypertext links are displayed
as rectangular outlines around words or graphics on a page.
Double-clicking SELECT on a link causes
.B helpviewer
to display the handbook and page to which the link points.
Handbooks may have links to other handbooks.
Certain types of hypertext links can also initiate system processes.
Double-clicking on these links will start up a program or shell script.
.TP
.B Page Magnification
Magnify or reduce the size of the handbook by pulling the resize corners on the
.B helpviewer
window, or select the "View->Custom Magnification" menu item.
Select the "View->Standard Magnification" menu item to reset the handbook
to the standard size.
For very high magnifications, select the "View->Partial Page" menu item
so that the
.B helpviewer
window still fits on the screen.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
.B HELPPATH
.IP 
This environment variable must be set to the directories that contain
help handbooks (e.g. $OPENWINHOME/lib/locale:$OPENWINHOME/lib/help). The
.B helpviewer
uses the
.BR $HELPPATH
variable to locate handbook files.  $HELPPATH is typically set automatically
during the OpenWindows startup process, so it is not usually necessary
to set it yourself.
