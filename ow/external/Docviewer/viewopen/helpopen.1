.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B helpopen
is a utility for programmatically controlling
.BR helpviewer (1).
.LP

to display the specified help handbook file.  If no
.B helpviewer
is running,
.B helpopen
starts one.
.LP
OpenWindows users do not typically need to use

directly.  It is used to implement the "more help"
feature in OpenWindows spot help.

accepts the following command line options:
.TP
.B \-f \f2help-handbook-file\fP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
.B helpopen
prints an error message on failure and returns non-zero exit status.
.SH BUGS

.B helpviewer 
and 
.B helpopen 
do not share the same view of the file system,
since they are separate processes and could be running on
different machines.
