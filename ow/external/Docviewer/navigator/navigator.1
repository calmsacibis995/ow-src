.SH NAME
navigator \- browse and search AnswerBook on-line documentation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B navigator
[
.B \-b
.I library-file
]
[
.B \-c
.I card-catalog
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B navigator
and 
.BR docviewer (1)
together comprise an OpenWindows
application for viewing and navigating
AnswerBook on-line document collections.
.LP
.B navigator 
provides three modes for accessing AnswerBook documents:
Contents (table-of-contents browsing), Search 
(full-text search and retrieval), and Bookmarks (links the
user creates to frequently referenced pages).
.LP
Documents found using 
.B navigator 
may then be viewed with 
.BR docviewer (1).
.LP
New to this version of
.B navigator
is the AnswerBook Library feature.  An AnswerBook library is a group of
AnswerBooks that can be browsed and searched as a single unit.
.B navigator
lets you select AnswerBooks of interest from those available on the network,
and add them to the current AnswerBook Library.
AnswerBook Library contents are stored in files and thus saved between
.B navigator
sessions.  In addition, these files may be shared among groups of AnswerBook
users, and even mailed to others.  See
.BR ab_library (4)
for more information.
.LP
You should not start
.B navigator
directly.  Instead, use the
.BR answerbook (1)
script, which performs certain operations to initialize and verify
the AnswerBook environment before starting
.B navigator.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b \f2library-file\fP
Specify the AnswerBook library to load.
The default library is $HOME/.ab_library.  See
.BR ab_library (4)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-c \f2card-catalog\fP
Specify the name of the card catalog file(s) used to locate AnswerBooks. See
.BR ab_cardcatalog (4)
for more information.
.TP
.SH USAGE
.TP
.B Contents Mode
Click SELECT on the "Contents" button near the top of the Navigator window
to browse the tables of contents of the AnswerBooks
in the current AnswerBook Library.
.RS
.LP
The Location list \- the upper scrolling list in Contents mode \- shows
the current path through the table of contents hierarchy.  The Contents (lower)
list show the contents of the current title in the location list.
.LP
Double-click SELECT on any bold-faced title in the Contents list
to display that title's contents.
The title itself moves to the bottom of the Location list,
and the first page of the corresponding document is displayed in the Viewer
window.  Non-bold-faced titles do not expand, but are displayed in the Viewer.
.LP
To move back up the table of contents hierarchy, just click SELECT
on any title in the Location list.  That document's contents will then
appear in the Contents list.
.RE
.TP
.B Search Mode
Click SELECT on the "Search" button near the top of the Navigator window
to perform full-text searches across all the AnswerBooks 
in the current AnswerBook Library.
.RS
.LP
The search query syntax is generally free-form (but see below).
Simply enter one or more words or phrases in the "Search Library for"
text window, then hit RETURN (or click SELECT on "Start Search" button)
to initiate the search.  The navigator displays the list of titles
of documents found, ranked in order of relevance to the search query.
The algorithm used to determine document relevance is heuristical,
and is based on word-occurrence statistics.
.LP
Double-click SELECT on any title in the list to display the corresponding
document in the Viewer window.
.LP
Search for literal phrases by enclosing them in double quotes:
.RS
.ft 8
.sp
.nf
"workspace properties"
.fi
.sp
.ft P
.RE
Search for words in proximity by enclosing them in parentheses:
.RS
.ft 8
.sp
.nf
(print mail messages)
.fi
.sp
.ft P
.RE
Match different work ending with an asterisk:
.RS
.ft 8
.sp
.nf
print* \f2(matches "print", "printer", "printing", etc.)\fP
.fi
.sp
.ft P
.RE
.TP
.B Previous Searches
Click SELECT on "Previous Searches..." to bring up a list of
earlier search queries.  The Previous Searches
window provides a simple copy-and-paste facility for redoing or
modifying queries.
.TP
.B Search Settings
Click SELECT on "Search Settings..." to modify search properties.
In the Search Settings window, you can select the search scope
(either the entire document, or just document titles);
the sorting order for the results list (by relevance, or by
book and relevance); and the maximum number of titles to display.
.RE
.TP
.B Bookmarks Mode
Click SELECT on the "Bookmarks" button near the top of the Navigator window
to browse the list of
bookmarks in the current AnswerBook Library.
Click Select on a bookmark in the
"Bookmarks in Library" list to display
the annotation for that bookmark in the "Comment for"
window.  Double-click SELECT on a bookmark
to display the corresponding document in the Viewer window
.RS
.LP
Click SELECT on the "Delete Bookmark" button to delete the currently
selected bookmark.  This operation cannot be undone.
.LP
The bookmark annotation in the "Comment for" window, as well as the
bookmark title on the "Comment for" line are editable.  Use the standard
textedit editing functions to modify them, then click SELECT
on the "Save Changes" button.
.RE
.TP
.B New Bookmark
Click SELECT on the "New Bookmark..." button to
create a bookmark to the current page in the Viewer window.
In the resulting New Bookmark pop-up window,
edit the bookmark title, and annotate it if desired, then click SELECT on the "Create" button to add the
new bookmark to the bookmark list for the current AnswerBook Library.
The updated bookmark list is automatically saved to the current Library file
so that it can be browsed the next time that file is loaded into
.B navigator.
.TP
.B Modify Library
Click SELECT on the "Modify Library..." button to bring up a list of
available AnswerBooks to include in the current AnswerBook Library.
Select one or more AnswerBooks from the list, then click SELECT on the
"Apply" button to put those AnswerBooks in the current Library.
This list of AnswerBooks is automatically saved to the current Library
file so that it is available when you next run
.B navigator.
.RS
.LP
The AnswerBooks shown in the Modify Library list are those found
in the AnswerBook Card Catalogs in your Card Catalog path.  See
.BR ab_cardcatalog (4)
for more information.
.LP
To prevent two people from updating the same AnswerBook Library file
at the same time (and thus losing data and/or corrupting the file),
.B navigator
sets an advisory lock on the file upon opening it.  If the file is
already locked,
.B navigator
gives you the option of opening it read-only, or resetting the lock.
If you open an AnswerBook Library file read-only, changes to that Library
(including bookmark changes) will not be saved.
You should reset a lock only if you know that it is no longer valid
(e.g., the navigator that set it is no longer running).
.RE
.TP
.B Starting Navigator
You should start
.B navigator
via the
.BR answerbook (1)
script rather than running it directly.  Command line arguments to
.B answerbook
are passed on to
.B navigator.
.RS
.LP
You can also start AnswerBook by opening an AnswerBook Library file
in File Manager, MailTool, or other DeskSet application.  See
.BR filemgr (1)
for details.
.LP
By default,
.B navigator
loads your personal AnswerBook Library file ($HOME/.ab_library)
when it starts.  Use the
.B \-b
.I library-file
option to load a different Library file (see
.B OPTIONS
).
.RE
.TP
Foreign Language Support
Some AnswerBooks contain translated documents in addition to the
English versions.
The user can specify
the preferred language at the beginning of an AnswerBook session
via the $LANG environment variable or the "-l" command line
flag.

and
.B docviewer
will display, search, etc., documents
in the preferred language when they are present in the
AnswerBook.
