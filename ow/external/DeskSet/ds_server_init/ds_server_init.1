.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH AVAILABILITY
Available with the OpenWindows environment.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B ds_server_init
is a utility which stores a property on 
the server representing the set of colors to be designated as 
the DeskSet colors.  This utility reduces colormap flashing
within applications requiring colors by restricting applications
to allocate colors only from the DeskSet colors.  As an application
requires a color, a best fit color algorithm is performed upon
the DeskSet colors to return the closest match from the DeskSet 
color list, thus avoiding to allocate duplicate colors that vary 
slightly.
.sp .5
The property is stored as a character string under the name 
_SUN_DESKSET_COLORS where the property string consists of a series 
of color strings in the hexadecimal form of color specification.  
The DeskSet colors are read in from the configurable file 
\fB$OPENWINHOME/share/xnews/client/ds_server_init/ds_colors.txt\fP.
If this file does not exist, \fBds_server_init\fP will default to a set
of its own back-up colors to store in the property.  
.B ds_server_init
will allow up to 240 colors to be set on the 
property.  
.sp .5
There are four additional colors (if they exist) that are added
to the DeskSet 
color list besides the colors specified in the color file.
These colors are stored in the user's \fB$HOME/.Xdefaults\fP file
and are 1) Window.ForegroundColor, 2) Window.BackgroundColor, 
3) OpenWindows.WorkspaceColor, and 4) OpenWindows.WindowColor.
.sp .5
Currently the
only applications using this property are the DeskSet tools,
but this concept can work on any application wishing to share colors
with the tools.
