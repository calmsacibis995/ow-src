.SH AVAILABILITY
Although this command is available with both the
SunView software installation option
and the
OpenWindows environment,
its appearance is not the
same for both environments.
The man page you are currently
viewing refers to the clock
that is available with OpenWindows. 
The primary difference between this and the 
SunView clock is the user interface.  
All OpenWindows standard tools
use the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B clock
is an OpenWindows XView utility that displays the current time in
a window or icon. When the window is open, 
.B clock 
can display
the time in  either analog or digital format. 
The clock window is scalable in either format.

tool by selecting either the 
.B Analog
or
.B Digital
choice box.
.LP
The icon displayed, can be either an
