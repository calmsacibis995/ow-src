.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mp
program reads each
.I filename
in sequence and generates a prettified version of the contents in
\*(Ps format, sent to standard output.
If no filename argument is provided,
.B mp
reads the standard input.
If the standard input is a terminal, input is terminated by an
.SM EOF
signal, usually
.SM Ctrl-D\s0.
.LP
Mail items, news articles, ordinary ASCII files, complete mail folders,
and digests are all acceptable input formats for
.BR mp .
The output format includes grayscale lozenges containing banner information
at the top and bottom of every page.
.LP
The program is conveniently used in conjunction with the print button of the
.BR mailtool (1)
program, or the
.I pipe
command provided by
.BR mail (1).
Add the following two lines to your \fB.mailrc\fP
file:
.br
.in +1.0i
.nf
\fBset printmail='mp | lp'
set cmd="mp | lp &"\fP
.fi
.in -1.0i
.LP
Source the \fB.mailrc\fP file, and you are ready to use \fBmp\fP.
For printing ordinary ASCII files, the following alias (to be placed in your
\fB.cshrc\fP file) may also prove useful:
.br
.in +1.0i
.nf
\fBalias print 'mp -o -s "\\!*" <\\!* | lp'\fP
.fi
.in -1.0i
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A4
Use A4 paper size (8.5 x 11.4 inches).
.TP
.B \-C
Instead of using "\\nFrom" to denote the start of new mail messages,
.B mp
will look for (and use) the value of the Content-Length: mail header. If the
Content-Length doesn't take you to the next "\\nFrom", then it's wrong, and
.B mp
falls back to looking for the next "\\nFrom" in the mail folder.
.TP
.B \-F
Instead of printing who the mail article is for, the top header will
contain who the mail article is from. A useful option for people with
their own personal printer.
.TP
.BI \-L " localename"
Provide the locale of the file to be printed. If this command line option is
not present, then
.B mp
looks for the
.I MP_LANG
environment variable. If that is not present, then the
.I LANG
environment variable is used. If none of these options are present, then
.B mp
tries to determine the locale it is running in, and if it cannot, then it
assumes it is running in the C locale, otherwise a prologue file
specific to the given locale is prepended to the output. This is to provide
I18N level 4 (multibyte) printing.
.TP
.B \-PS
If the mail or digest message just has PostScript as the text of the message,
then this is normally just passed straight through. Specifying this option,
causes PostScript to be printed as text.
.TP
.B \-US
Use US paper size (8.5 x 11 inches).
This is the default paper size.
.TP
.B \-a
Format the file as a news article.
The top banner contains the text:
"Article from \fInewsgroup\fP", where \fInewsgroup\fP\fP
is the first news group found on the Newsgroups: line.
.TP
.BI \-c " chars"
The maximum number of characters to extract from the gecos field of the users
\fB/etc/passwd\fP entry. The default is 18.
.TP
.B \-d
Format the file as a digest.
.TP
.B \-e
Assume the ELM mail frontend intermediate file format. Used when printing
messages from within ELM (using the "p" command), especially for printing
tagged messages. This option must be specified in your ELM option setup.
.TP
.B \-ff
Format the file for use with a Filofax personal organiser.
.TP
.B \-fp
Format the file for use with a Franklin Planner personal organiser.
.TP
.B \-l
Format output in landscape mode.
Two pages of text will be printed per sheet of paper.
.TP
.B \-m
Format the file as a mail folder, printing multiple messages.
.TP
.B \-o
Format the file as an ordinary ASCII file.
.TP
.BI \-p " prologue"
Employ the file
.I prologue
as the \*(Ps prologue file,
overriding any previously defined file names.
.TP
.BI \-s " subject"
Use
.I " subject"
as the new subject for the printout. If you are printing ordinary ASCII
files which have been specified on the command line, the the subject will
default to the name of each of these files.
.TP
.B \-tm
Format the file for use with the Time Manager personal organiser.
.TP
.B \-ts
format the file for use with the Time/System International personal organiser.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number of this release of
.IR mp .
.TP
.BI \-w " words"
The maximum number of words to extract from the gecos field of the users
.I /etc/passwd
entry. The default is 3.
.TP
.B \-?
Print the usage line for
.B mp
(note that the
.B ?
character must be escaped if using
.BR csh (1)).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The
.B mp
prologue file is determined by first looking for the environment variable
.IR MP_PROLOGUE ,
which specifies the directory where
.B mp
prologue files are to be found.
If
.I MP_PROLOGUE
is not found, then the default directory is assumed
.RI ( $OPENWINHOME/share/xnews/client/mp ).
.LP
.B mp
also checks for the
.I MP_LANG
and
.I LANG
environment variables. If present, then a prologue file called
.RI ( $OPENWINHOME/lib/locale/<localename>/print/prolog.ps )
is prepended to the output to be printed.
.SH "SUPPLIED PROLOGUE FILES"
The following prologue files are provided:
.RS
.TP
.I mp.pro.ps
Used by default
.TP
.I mp.pro.ff.ps
Used if the
.B \-ff
option is in effect
.TP
.I mp.pro.fp.ps
Used if the
.B \-fp
option is in effect
.TP
.I mp.pro.tm.ps
Used if the
.B \-tm
option is in effect
.TP
.I mp.pro.ts.ps
Used if the
.B \-ts
option is in effect
.TP
.I mp.pro.alt.ps
An alternative modification of the default prologue file which outputs the
