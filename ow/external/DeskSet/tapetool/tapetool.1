or archiving files to tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tapetool 
[ 
.I generic-tool-arguments
]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This command is available with the OpenWindows environment.
All OpenWindows standard tools use the 
.SW OPEN LOOK 
Graphical User Interface (
.SM GUI
). 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B tapetool 
is an OpenWindows based XView application that
uses the 
.BR tar (1) 
command to write files to tape, extract files 
from tape or list the contents of a tape.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.I generic-tool-arguments
.B tapetool
accepts the generic tool arugments described in
.BR xview (7).
.SH USAGE
.LP
.B tapetool 
is part of the OpenWindows user environment.  
.LP
There are two windows associated with 
.B tapetool. 
The main window that appears when the tool is 
initially brought up is for writing files to tape.  
The read window appears when you 
.RB ` List ' 
the contents of a tape or choose either
.RB ` "Read Selected" ' 
or 
.RB ` "Read Entire List" '. 
.LP
.RB ` "List..." ' 
panel-button brings up a 
.RB ` "Tape Contents' " 
window that lists the files on tape. 
Filenames can be added using the 
.RB ` "File To Read" '
button. 
Filenames can be deleted using the scrolling 
list popup menu. 
It may take some time listing the entire contents 
of a tape if it contains many files. 
If you want to extract just a few files and 
know the exact names of the files you may 
want to do a 
.RB ` "Read Selected" ' 
that will bring up an empty 
.RB ` "Tape Contents" ' 
window. 
Then add the filenames to the list using the
.RB ` "File To Read" ' 
button and do a 
.RB ` "Read Entire List" '.
.LP
There are three ways to read files:
.RS
.TP 10
.B "Read Selected"
Reads the files selected in the 
.RB ` "Tape Contents" ' 
window.
.TP
.B "Read Entire List" 
Reads all the files listed in the
.RB ` "Tape Contents" ' 
window.
.TP
.B "Read Entire Tape"
Reads the entire tape. The
.RB ` "Tape Contents" ' 
window does not have to be showing to do this.  
The files are put into the directory specified 
by the 
.RB ` Destination ' 
field if they do not contain fully qualified pathnames.
.RE
.LP	
To write files to tape, add filenames to the 
main scrolling list using the
.RB ` "File To Write" ' 
menu button. 
The main scrolling list has a popup menu
for deleting selected files.  
.RB ` Write ' 
writes the filenames listed in this window to tape.  
.LP
.B "Props" 
gives a property sheet for specifying 
.BR tar (1) 
options.

.B "Write:"
.RS
.TP 15
.B "No \s-1SCCS\s0"
F option to 
.BR tar (1), 
exclude all directories named 
.SM SCCS 
from tarfile.
.TP
.B "No \s-1SCCS\s0+"
FF option to 
.BR tar (1), 
exclude all directories named 
.SM SCCS, 
all files with 
.B .o 
as their suffix, and all files named 
.BR errs , core , 
and 
.BR a.out .
.TP
.B "Block I/0"
.B b 
option to 
.BR tar (1), 
blocking factor for tape records.
The default blocking factor is 20 blocks. 
The block size is determined automatically 
when reading tapes.  
This determination of the blocking factor may be 
fooled when reading from a pipe or a socket. 
The maximum blocking factor is determined only 
by the amount of memory available to 
.B tar 
when it is run.  
Larger blocking factors result in better throughput, 
longer blocks on nine-track tapes, and better media 
utilization.
.TP
.B "Sym Links"
.B h 
option to 
.BR tar (1), 
follow symbolic links as if they were normal files 
or directories.
