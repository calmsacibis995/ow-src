			Tooltalk Sample Program

Description:
	This sample codes shows a working yet simple editor that can be
	launched from mailtool when a user double clicks on a text
	attachment. To test it out perform the following steps:

1 - save your original setup "tt_type_comp -p > save_file"

2 - run "make"

3 - run "make tooltalk"

4 - exit mailtool AND ttsession

5 - in ONE shelltool
	A - set the environment variable XENVIRONMENT to be the
		full path to the Resources file.
		"setenv XENVIRONMENT /usr/openwin/demo/tooltalk/Resources"

	B - set your path environment variable to be this directory.

	C - restart ttsession so that it has BOTH these environment variables.

6 - restart mailtool and select a text attachment.

When your testing is done and you want to go back to your original setup
you can "tt_type_comp save_file" OR if you had no local changes to begin
with you can just "rm -rf ~/.tt"
