.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B textedit
is a window-based \s-1XV\s0iew application 
that provides both mouse and pointer operations 
and keyboard accelerators for the editing of
text. 
In general, text editing throughout the OpenWindows
user environment uses
.B textedit
conventions, both in text display areas such 
as mail message windows and command panel text fields.
.LP
.B textedit 
operates via a set of command panel buttons and text
fields and a set of menus and submenus accessible from the main
editing window.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP 
.I generic-tool-arguments
.B textedit

.SH USAGE
.B textedit
is part of the OpenWindows user environment.
.SS Signal Processing
.LP
If
.B textedit
hangs, for whatever reason, you can send a
.SB SIGHUP
signal to its process
.SM ID\s0,
which forces it to write any changes
(if possible):
.IP
.BI "kill \-\s-1HUP\s0 " pid
.LP
The edits are written to the file 
.BI textedit. pid
in its working directory.
If that fails,
.B textedit
successively tries to write to a file by that name in
.BR /var/tmp ,
and then
.BR /tmp .
In addition, whenever
.B textedit
catches a fatal signal, such as 
.BR \s-1SIGILL\s0 ,
it tries to write out the edits before aborting.
.SS Defaults Options
.LP
There are several dozen user-specified defaults that affect
the behavior of the text-based facilities.  See 
.BR xview (7)
for a complete description.
Important defaults entries in the
.B Text
category are:
.TP 18
.B Checkpoint_frequency
If set to
.B 0
(the standard default) no checkpointing is done.
For any value greater than zero, a checkpoint 
is made each time the indicated number of
editing operations has been performed since 
the last checkpoint.
Each character typed, each
.BR Paste ,
and each
.B Cut
counts as an editing operation.
The checkpoint file has a name of the form:
.IB filename %%\fP,
where
.I filename
is the name of the file being edited.
.SS Selections
.LP
Selections in 
.B textedit
are defined as selected portions of text to 
which editing operations can be applied. 
For example, a selection can be
.I deleted, moved, copied,
etc.
.LP
.B textedit
provides two types of selections: primary and secondary.
Primary selections allow you to select a set of 
text on which to perform an editing function. 
Secondary selections allow you to define a 
.I second
block of text without undefining your primary 
text selection or repositioning your cursor. 
Being able to define two sets of text at once 
allows you to take advantage of the advanced editing
functions described below in the section called
.B Function Keys.
.TP 10
.B Using a Mouse and Pointer:
.RS
Single characters can be selected using the
.SM SELECT
mouse button. 
.sp .5
Blocks of text can be selected by selecting a starting point with the
.SM SELECT
mouse button and selecting an ending point with the
.SM ADJUST
button.
.sp .5
Or blocks of text can be selected using OPEN LOOK's
.I wipe through
feature by pointing at a beginning character and depressing the
.SM SELECT
button while moving the pointer to the end of a block of text.
.sp .5
Selections can also be made by
.I clicking
(rapidly pressing) the 
.SM SELECT
button. Click once to select a single letter;
click twice to select a word; click three times to select
a complete line of text; click four times to select the
entire document being edited.
.RE
.TP
.B Visual Feedback 
.RS
All primary selections are indicated visually 
by inverse video of the text selected and are
.I pending delete.
Pending delete selections are replaced if you 
type or paste while the text is selected.
.sp .5
Secondary selections that are not 
.I pending delete
are indicated by underlining of the text.
.sp .5
Secondary selections pending delete are indicated by underlining
of the text and strike through of the individual characters.
.RE
.SS Secondary Selections
.LP
Secondary selections are made using any of 
the selection methods described above in 
addition to holding down one of the four function keys
corresponding to the commands
.BR Cut ,
.BR Find ,
.BR Paste ,
or
.BR Copy  .
.LP
Secondary selections are made pending delete by holding the
.SM CTRL
key when making the secondary selection.
If a secondary selection is pending-delete,
it is deleted when the function key is released, except in the case
of the 
.BR Find ,
which deselects the secondary selection.
.LP
Commands that operate on the primary selection do so even if the
primary selection is not in the window that issued the command.
.RE
.SS "Inserting Text and Command Characters"
.LP
For the most part, typing any of the standard
keys either inserts the corresponding character
at the insertion point, or erases characters.
However, certain key combinations are treated as commands.
Some of the most useful are:
.LP
.ta 20n 35n

			and moves it to the Clipboard.
\f3\s-1Help\s0\fP	F1	F1	Produces help text.
.fi
.LP
.B Find
usually searches the text forwards, towards the end.
Holding down the 
.SM SHIFT
key while invoking
.B Find
searches backward through the text, towards the beginning.
If the pattern is not found before the search encounters
either extreme, it \*(lqwraps around\*(rq and
continues from the other extreme.
.B Find
starts the search at the appropriate end of the primary selection,
if the primary selection is in the subwindow that the search is made in;
otherwise it starts at the insertion point, unless the subwindow cannot
be edited, in which case it starts at the beginning of the text.
.LP
\s-1CTRL\s0-Find
invokes the
.B Find and Replace
pop-up frame.
