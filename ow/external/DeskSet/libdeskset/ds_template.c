/*
 * This routine attempts to create a temporary file from a specified
 * template.  It will make sure that it is a unique file.  It expands
 * "%t" as the variable part of the file name.
 *
 * %t will be treated as a "small integer" that is incremented.
 * To avoid race conditions, the name is actually created to hold
 * its place.  This integer is bounded to avoid spending an insane
 * amount of time searching the directory.
 *
 * This algorithm has a major problem -- creating multiple names
 * turns into an N^2 problem.  I thought of doing some sort of
 * binary search, but the algorithm is non-trivial in the face of
 * multiple apps trying to get names at the same time.  This
 * algorithm has the benefit of utter simplicity.
 *
 * It return's a malloc'ed buffer that the calling proceedure needs
 * to free later...
