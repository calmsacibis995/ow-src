*       Function:       ds_expand_pathname
*
*       Description:    Expand ~'s and environment variables in a path.
*		
*			This routine was stolen from filemgr. I've made a
*			couple of small changes to better handle "~user"
*			at the start of a path.
*
*       Parameters:     path	Unexpanded path
*                       bug    	Returned expanded path.  Caller is responsible
*				allocating enough space.
*
*       Returns:        Nothing
