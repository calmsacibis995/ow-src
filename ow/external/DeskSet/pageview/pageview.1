.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pageview
is an interactive \*(Ps previewer. 
.B pageview
renders a document, a page at a time, onto an offscreen bitmap
of arbitrary size, resolution and orientation.
You can then adjust the viewing window's size to see as much of the
page as desired.
The mouse buttons are used to position the page under the window in two
different modes.
.LP
The left button moves the page in "relative mode".
This allows you to move the page in a physically intuitive way.
You press the left button on the page and while you drag the mouse around,
the spot on the page that was under the mouse cursor when you pressed the
button remains stationary relative to the cursor.
.LP
The middle button moves the page in "absolute mode".
This allows you to easily get to the edges of the document, especially when
the DPI is large and/or the window is small.  When you press the middle
button on a point in the window, the page is adjusted so that the same
relative point on the page is under the mouse.
For example, if you press the middle button at the top right corner of the
window, you will see the top right corner of the page.
A little experimentation with a page at 300 dpi and you will find this
mode indispensable.
.LP
The three menu buttons across the top of the main window are
described below:
.TP 9
.B File
The File menu is used to bring up the Load... or Print... dialogs.
.TP 9
.B Load...
brings up a dialog which prompts for a directory and filename to load a
new \*(Ps file.
.TP 9
.B Print...
brings up a dialog which prompts for the name of the printer to send the
\*(Ps  document to.
You can print the whole document or only the current page.
You may also write the \*(Ps to a named file.
.TP 9
.B View
The View menu allows you to move to the Next, Previous, First and Last
pages of multipage documents.
.TP 9
.B Edit
The edit menu has two choices, \*(Ps and Properties.
.TP 9
.B PostScript...
brings up a text editor with the \*(Ps document in it and a window
which contains all of the errors and other output from the document.
You may make changes to the document and press the run button to
re-render the page.
.TP 9
.B Properties...
brings up the property sheet for page size, orientation and resolution.
.TP 9
.B DPI:
This lets you change the "resolution" of the retained bitmap which the page
is being rendered onto.
72 dpi will make a US Letter sized page be 612x792 pixels, where 300 dpi
would be 2550x3300 pixels.
This has the effect of making 72 dpi images appear smaller and 300 dpi pages
appear larger due to the static resolution of the display.
.B pageview
starts out at 85 dpi, unless you have the environment variable 
.SB $DPI 
set to some other default, or you use the \fB-dpi\fP command line argument.
.TP 9
.B Size:
This lets you change the size of the retained bitmap which the page is
rendered onto.
USLetter is 8.5x11", Legal is 8.5x14", and the European page sizes are,
A3 29.7 x 42.0 cm, A4 21.0 X 29.7 cm, A5 14.8 x 21.0 cm, and B5 17.6 x 25.0 cm.
These values can be set to custom values by the
.B \-height
and
.B \-width
command line arguments.
.TP 9
.B Orientation:
This menu lets you choose which way to rotate the paper in 90 degree increments.
This is useful for viewing slides which are commonly rendered in "Landscape
left" orientation.
.TP 9
.B Timeout:
This option allows you to select the job timeout value.
This value is used by
.B pageview
as the amount of time in which a page of a document must be rendered onto
the screen.
If the page cannot be rendered in this time,
.B pageview
assumes that there is some sort of \*(Ps error on the page which
is causing this problem (such as a string or procedure that does not end)
and stops trying to display the page.
However, often times, documents that contain complex graphics may
take a longer than average amount of time to display.
In this case, you should increase the job timeout value and attempt
to display the page again.
.TP 9
.B Ignore PostScript Structuring Comments:
.B pageview
is designed to scan a \*(Ps file and determine the
different sections of it based on \*(Ps Structuring Comments.
For example, from reading these comments,
.B pageview
determines where each page of the document starts and ends.
However, as there are many \*(Ps documents that do not use
the comments,
.B pageview
often gets confused as to the number of pages in a document and/or where
they began and end.
Therefore, if you attempt to view a document, but feel that the
resulting displayed document does not look as you expected, you may
want to turn on this option.
This option will assume that there are no \*(Ps Structuring
comments, and interpret the file differently.
Be aware though, this method of interpreting the \*(Ps file may be
slower than the default method, especially if the file is very big.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B \-mono
is used to force
.B pageview
to use a monochrome retained canvas on color systems.
This saves memory and is faster on some framebuffers.
.TP 9
.BI \-w \ paperwidth
sets the width of the "paper" to
.I paperwidth
inches, the default is 8.5.
.TP 9
.BI \-h \ paperheight
sets the height of the "paper" to
.I paperheight
inches, the default is 11.
.TP 9
.BI \-dpi \ dots/inch
sets the "dpi" of the "paper" to
.IR dots/inch .
The environment variable 
.SB $DPI 
is used if this option is not present, and the
default is 85 if this variable is not in the environment.
Caution must be used in setting this argument as well as the paper size
args above, so you do not exhaust memory resources.
For example a USLetter sized page previewed at 300 dpi, takes up
300*8.5/8*300*11 or a little over a Megabyte.
The same page at 1500 dpi takes over 26 Megabytes.
.TP 9
.BI \-mcd \ colordensity
Sets the maximum color density.
The default maximum color density is 100.
However, if an image is to be viewed with a DPI greater than 100, it will not
be displayed in color unless the maximum color density is set greater
than 100.
.TP 9
.BI \-page \ pagenumber
Sets the page number of the document that is to be displayed when
.B pageview
starts.
.TP 9
.BI \-dir \ directory
Sets the current working directory to
.I directory
so that you can type filenames at the "Load File: " prompt relative to
.IR directory .
.TP 9
.B \-left|right|upsidedown
Sets the rotation of the page.
.TP 9
.BI \-timeout " job_timeout (sec)"
Sets the job timeout value.
The default job timeout value is 30 seconds.
.TP 9
.B \-aa
Turns on antialiasing.
.TP 9
.B \-low_memory
Runs a low memory version of 
.B pageview.
This version does not create the offscreen bitmap, and rather
renders the document directly onto the viewing canvas.
This uses less memory, but performance may suffer especially
when the
.B pageview
window is hidden and then exposed, as the entire page must
be rendered again.
If the user attempts to move the page in "relative mode"
(pan), the offscreen bitmap is automatically created as this
function is not possible without it.
Also, this option cannot be used if antialiasing is turned on.
.TP 9
.B \-usage
Prints out all valid command line options.
.TP 9
.B \-v
Prints out the current version of
.B pageview.
.TP 9
.B \-verbose
Prints lots of debugging information (not useful to the user)
.TP 0
If \fBpsfile\fP is specified, the \*(Ps code is taken from that file.
If no argument is given,
.B pageview
comes up with no document in it and if
a `\-' is given as the argument,
.B pageview
reads the \*(Ps program from standard input.
