/* ppmdraw.h - header file for simple drawing routines in libppm
**
** Simple, yes, and also fairly slow if the truth be told; but also very
** flexible and powerful.
**
** The two basic concepts are the drawproc and clientdata.  All the drawing
** routines take a drawproc that does the actual drawing.  A drawproc draws
** a single point, and it looks like this:
*/
void ppmd_point_drawproc ARGS(( pixel** pixels, int cols, int rows, pixval maxval, int x, int y, char* clientdata ));
/*
** So, you call a drawing routine, e.g. ppmd_line(), and pass it a drawproc;
** it calls the drawproc for each point it wants to draw.  Why so complicated?
** Because you can define your own drawprocs to do more interesting things than
** simply draw the point.  For example, you could make one that calls back into
** another drawing routine, say ppmd_circle() to draw a circle at each point
** of a line.
**
** Slow?  Well sure, we're talking results here, not realtime.  You can do
** tricks with this arrangement that you couldn't even think of before.
** Still, to speed things up for the 90% case you can use this:

#else /*__STDC__*/
#define PPMD_NULLDRAWPROC (void (*)()) 0
#endif /*__STDC__*/
/*
** Just like ppmd_point_drawproc() it simply draws the point, but it's done
** inline, and clipping is assumed to be handled at a higher level.
**
** Now, what about clientdata.  Well, it's an arbitrary pointer, and can
** mean something different to each different drawproc.  For the above two
** drawprocs, clientdata should be a pointer to a pixel holding the color
** to be drawn.  Other drawprocs can use it to point to something else,
** e.g. some structure to be modified, or they can ignore it.
