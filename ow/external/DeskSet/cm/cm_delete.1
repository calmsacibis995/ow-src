.SH NAME
cm_delete \- delete appointments from Calendar Manager database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cm_delete 
[
.BI -c \ calendar
] [
.BI -d \ date
] [
.BI -v \ view
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B cm_delete
utility is a tty interface to Calendar Manager
.BR cm (1).
It can be used to delete appointments from the cm
database via the RPC daemon
.BR rpc.cmsd (1).
Appointments are deleted one at a time.  Each of the components of an
appointment is specified using one of the command line flags followed
by the desired value.  The current list of appointments for the
specified date (see date, view options) is displayed, numbered sequentially
starting with 1.  User is prompted for the number to delete.
Once an appointment
is deleted, the list of remaining appointments is redisplayed.  At this point
the user may specify another number, or just <return> to quit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.BI \-c " calendar"
The name of the target
calendar.  Calendar names take the form
"user@host", where the user is a user's login
name and the host is the host machine name.
An example is "felix@cat".  If no target
calendar is specified, calendar defaults to
the current user at the current host machine.
.TP
.BI \-d " date"
The deletion date for the appointment.  The
date is specified using the form "mm/dd/yy",
although certain other references such as
"today", "Tuesday", "tomorrow", etc. are
correctly calculated.  If no date is
specified, date defaults to today's date.
.TP
.BI \-v " view"
View span.  This controls the span of
time to display.  The user may specify "day",
"week", or "month".  The "day" view displays
all appointments for the given date (see -d
option above).  The "week" view displays the
full week which contains the given date,
starting with Sunday.  The "month" view
displays the entire month which contains the
given date, starting with the first of the
month. The default view is "day".

.SH USAGE
.LP
The various components of an appointment are specified using
command line flags followed by the desired value.  Values
may have embedded spaces, punctuation, etc., although
quotes may be needed around strings which contain certain
characters to protect them from interpretation by the local
shell (e.g. /bin/csh).  An argument is taken to begin at
the first space after a flag and to continue until the
first "-" after a space.
