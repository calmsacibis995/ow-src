.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B cm_insert
utility is a tty interface to Calendar Manager
.BR cm (1).
It can be used to add new appointments to the cm
database via the RPC daemon rpc.cmsd.  Appointments are
added one at a time.  Each of the components of an
appointment is specified using one of the command line
flags followed by the desired value.  Once an appointment
is added, the list of appointments for the specified date
(see date, view options) is displayed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.BI \-c " calendar"
The name of the target
calendar.  Calendar names take the form
"user@host", where the user is a user's login
name and the host is the host machine name.
An example is "felix@cat".  If no target
calendar is specified, calendar defaults to
the current user at the current host machine.
.TP
.BI \-d " date"
The insertion date for the appointment.  The
date is specified using the form "mm/dd/yy",
although certain other references such as
"today", "Tuesday", "tomorrow", etc. are
correctly calculated.  If no date is
specified, date defaults to today's date.
.TP
.BI \-s " start"
The starting time for the appointment. The
time is specified using the form "hh:mm" plus
an optional "am" or "pm" meridian.  If
"am/pm" is left off, "am" is assumed. Time
specified using 24-hour convention (e.g.
"15:30" instead of "3:30 pm") are acceptable
and are converted to meridian time before
insertion.  If no starting time is specified,
starting time defaults to "magic" time (see
Calendar Manager manual) and no time appears
next to the appointment.
.TP
.BI \-e " end"
The ending time for the appointment. The
time is specified as above "starting time".
It is considered an error to specify an
ending time without specifying a starting
time.
.TP
.BI \-v " view"
View span.  This controls the span of
time to display.  The user may specify "day",
"week", or "month".  The "day" view displays
all appointments for the given date (see -d
option above).  The "week" view displays the
full week which contains the given date,
starting with Sunday.  The "month" view
displays the entire month which contains the
given date, starting with the first of the
month. The default view is "day".
.TP
.BI \-w " what"
What the appointment is about.  The
user may specify a string of text describing
the nature of the appointment.  Up to 5 lines
of text can be specified by placing "\\n"
(actual characters "\\" and "n", not newline)
between lines.  It may be necessary to
escape the "\\" character ("\\\\n") or enclose
string in quotes (""this string in quotes"")
to avoid interpretation by the local shell.
If not specified, "what" defaults to
"Appointment".

.SH USAGE
.LP
The various components of an appointment are specified using
command line flags followed by the desired value.  Values
may have embedded spaces, punctuation, etc., although
quotes may be needed around strings which contain certain
characters to protect them from interpretation by the local
shell (e.g. /bin/csh).  An argument is taken to begin at
the first space after a flag and to continue until the
first "-" after a space.
