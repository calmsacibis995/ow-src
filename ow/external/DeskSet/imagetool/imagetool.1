can be used to view the contents of a variety of file types such as
gif, tiff, jfif (jpeg) and \*(Ps.

.TP 0
There are two other buttons in the main panel with forward and backward arrows
on them.  These buttons become active when a multipage document is loaded.
Using these buttons, the user may page forward or backward.
.sp
At the far right of the main panel, there is a drop target which has two functions.
First, the user may drag files from another application
(
.BR filemgr (1)
for example) and drop them in the drop target.
This causes them to be loaded into the \f3imagetool\f1 and displayed.
Alternately, after a file has been loaded into the \f3imagetool\f1
for display, the user may drag a copy of the file out of \f3imagetool\f1
by moving the mouse pointer to the drop target, pressing down on the left mouse
button and dragging the resulting file image to another application (\f3filemgr\f1
again for example ).
.sp
Below the main panel, there is a canvas on which the image is displayed.
When \f3imagetool\f1
starts up, it tries to create the window to fit the size of the image.
However, if the image is very large, it may only show a portion of it.
The user may however, use the scrollbars attached to the display canvas
to move around within the image.

.SH RESOURCES 
.TP 0
On startup, imagetool will use the following X resources which
are stored in $HOME/.desksetdefaults.
Note these resource names will be prepended with deskset.imagetool.
.TP 15
.PD 0
.B Resource:
ViewImageIn
.TP 
.B Values: 
Color, GrayScale (Color)
.TP
.B Description:
Determines if images will be displayed in color or grayscale. If user
is using a monochrome monitor, this setting has no affect.
.sp
.TP 15
.PD 0
.B Resource:
Colors
.TP
.B Values:
BW, 16, 256, Millions (256)
.TP
.B Description:
Sets the number of colors to be used when viewing images. This resource
only is used if a multi-plane framebuffer is being used. Note that for
most color monitors, only 256 colors are possible.
.sp
.TP 15
.PD 0
.B Resource:
DisplayPalette
.TP
.B Values:
True, False (True)
.TP
.B Description:
Determines if palette is automatically displayed when first image is
opened by imagetool.
.sp
.TP 15
.PD 0
.B Resource:
UseDSC
.TP 
.B Values:
True, False (False)
.TP
.B Description:
Determines how \*(Ps documents are interpreted.
A well written \*(Ps file contains Document Structuring
Comments which separate various sections of the document.
If the comments are used correctly, then it is easy to
determine where each page of the document begins and ends.
By default, 
.B imagetool
does not look for these comments when determining pages.
Because of this, backward paging can be slow
since the only way to verify that the displayed page will
look correct is to begin at the beginning of the document
and render pages until the desired page is found.
If the user finds that the performance is not acceptable,
then this resource may be set, at which time,
.B imagetool
will use the Document Structuring Comments to determine where
each page begins and ends.
Note that this may help performance, but that displayed
pages may not look correct due to no comments being found
in the document, or the comments being used incorrectly.
