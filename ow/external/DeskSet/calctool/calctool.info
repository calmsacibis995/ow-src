Calculator display

The bottom of the display shows the current mode
of operation for:

Number base 		BIN (binary), OCT (octal),
			DEC (decimal), or HEX
	     	 	(hexadecimal)

Trigonometric base	DEG (degrees), GRAD
			(gradients),or RAD
			(radians)

Display type		ENG (engineering), FIX
			(fixed point), or SCI
			(scientific)

Mode			BASIC, FINANCIAL,
			LOGICAL, or SCIENTIFIC

At certain times, the following may also be
displayed:

HYP 	(hyperbolic mode is set)
INV 	(inverse mode is set)

These pertain only to trigonometrical
calculations.

When the calculator needs to be "cleared,"
"CLR" will be displayed.

The display also shows the current mathematical 
operation and function when this operation 
requires other input to be complete.

General Help

Precision: All calculations are correct to the
number of digits of accuracy specified. Very 
large or very small results will cause an error.

Cut/Paste to other windows: The Caculator
display works with the Cut and Paste function keys
to paste numbers in other windows.

Keyboard equivalents: For every mouse selection,
there is an equivalent keystroke. Click on the 
Keys button to display those keystrokes.

Error condition: If an error condition occurs,
you must clear the calculator.

   Register 1 - int (periodic interest rate)
   Register 2 - n   (term)

Example:

You have just won a million dollars. The prize 
is awarded in 20 annual payments of $50,000 each 
(a total of $1,000,000 over 20 years). Annual 
payments are received at the end of each year. 

You are given the option of receiving a single 
lump-sum payment of $400,000 instead of the 
million dollars annuity. You want to find out 
which option is worth more in today's dollars.

If you were to accept the annual payments of 
$50,000, you assume that you would invest the 
money at a rate of 9%, compounded annually.

Memory register usage:
 
   Register 0 - 50000 (periodic payment).
   Register 1 - 0.09  (periodic interest rate 
			is 9%)
   Register 2 - 20    (term)

Clicking SELECT on Pv returns a value of 
456427.28, which tells you that the $1,000,000 
paid over 20 years is worth $456,427.28 in
present dollars. 

Based on your assumptions, the lump-sum
payment of $400,000 is worth less than the 
million-dollar ordinary annuity, in present 
dollars (before taxes).

Rate

Periodic interest rate

Keyboard equivalent:   Control-r

Returns the periodic interest necessary for a 
present value of pv to grow to a future value of 
fv over the number of compounding periods in term.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - fv (future value).
   Register 1 - pv (present value).
   Register 2 - n  (term).

Example:

You have invested $20,000 in a bond. The bond 
matures in five years, and has a maturity value
of $30,000. Interest is compounded monthly. You 
want to determine the periodic interest rate for 
this investment.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - 30000 (future value)
   Register 1 - 20000 (present value)
   Register 2 - 60    (term - 5 x 12)

Clicking SELECT on Rate returns .00678, which 
tells you that the periodic (monthly) interest 
rate is 0.678%, under 1% per month.

To determine the annual rate, multiply the above 
formula by 12, which yields a result of 8.14%.

Sln

Straight-line depreciation

Keyboard equivalent:   Control-s

Computes the straight-line depreciation of an 
asset for one period. 

The straight-line method of depreciation divides 
the depreciable cost (cost - salvage) evenly over 
the useful life of an asset. The useful life is 
the number of periods (typically years) over 
which an asset is depreciated.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - cost     (cost of the asset)
   Register 1 - salvage  (salvage value of the 
			  asset)
   Register 2 - life     (useful life of the 
			  asset)

Example:

You have purchased an office machine for $8,000. 
The useful life of this machine is six years, 
and the salvage value in eight years will be 
$900. You want to compute yearly depreciation 
expense, using the straight-line method.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - 8000     (cost of the asset)
   Register 1 - 900      (salvage value of the 
			  asset)
   Register 2 - 6        (useful life of the 
			  asset)

Clicking SELECT on Sln returns 1183.33, the yearly 
dollar depreciation allowance.

Syd

Sum-of-the years'-digits depreciation

Keyboard equivalent:   Control-y

Returns the sum-of-the-years'-digits depreciation 
for a specified period.

The sum-of-the-years'-digits method of 
depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation,
so that more depreciation expense occurs in
earlier periods than in later ones. 

The depreciable cost is the actual cost minus 
salvage value. The useful life is the number of 
periods (typically years) over which an asset is 
depreciated.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - cost     (cost of the asset)
   Register 1 - salvage  (salvage value of 
			  the asset)
   Register 2 - life     (useful life of the 
			  asset)
   Register 3 - period   (period for which 
			 depreciation is computed)

Example:

You have just purchased an office machine for 
$8,000. The useful life of this machine is six 
years, and the salvage value after eight years 
will be $900. 

You want to compute the depreciation expense for 
the fourth year, using the sum-of-the-years'-
digits method.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - 8000    (cost of the asset)
   Register 1 - 900     (salvage value of 
	  		 the asset)
   Register 2 - 6       (useful life of the 
			 asset)
   Register 3 - 4       (period for which 
			 depreciation is computed)

Clicking SELECT on Syd returns 1014.29, the dollar 
depreciation allowance for the fourth year.

:Term:$OPENWINHOME/bin/helpopen handbooks/calc.handbook
Term

Payment period

Keyboard equivalent:   T

Returns the number of payment periods in the term 
of an ordinary annuity necessary to accumulate a
future value of fv, earning a periodic interest 
rate of int. Each payment is equal to amount pmt.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - pmt (periodic payment)
   Register 1 - fv  (future value)
   Register 2 - int (periodic interest rate)

Example:

You deposit $1,800 at the end of each year into 
a bank account. Your account earns 11% a year, 
compounded annually. You want to determine how 
long it will take to accumulate $120,000.

Memory register usage:

   Register 0 - 1800    (periodic payment)
   Register 1 - 120000  (future value)
   Register 2 - 0.11    (periodic interest rate 
			 is 11%)

Clicking SELECT on Term returns 20.32, the number
of years it will take to accumulate $120,000 in 
your account.
