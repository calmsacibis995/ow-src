.SH DESCRIPTION
.B calctool
is a desktop calculator. It has been designed to be used with
either the mouse or the keyboard. It is visually similar to a lot of
hand-held calculators. There are financial, logical and scientific modes.
Similar operations are color coded on color workstations. Some of the
calculator keys have menu marks. This indicates that there is a menu
associated with that key. Each key is discussed in more detail below.
.LP
One of the most important things to remember about
.B calctool
is that calculations are performed from left to right, with no arithmetic
precedence. If you need arithmetic precedence, then you should use
parentheses (see below).
.LP
Internal arithmetic is now done with multi-precision floating point numbers.
Accuracy can be adjusted from zero to nine numeric places in fixed notation,
but numbers can be displayed in engineering and scientific notation as well.
The calculator reverts to scientific notation when the number is larger than
the display would allow in fixed notation. The base of operation can be
changed between binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal.  Numbers are
initially displayed in fixed notation to two numeric places, in the decimal
base.
.LP
You can use the
.I Copy
and
.I Paste
functions in conjunction with the numeric display to store or
retrieve characters from the text shelf. You can also remove the last digit
entered, and the whole display can be cleared.
.LP
There are ten memory registers. Numbers can be stored or retrieved in these
locations, and arithmetic can be performed upon register contents.
.LP
The display windows contains the current numerical value plus the current
base and trigonometric type. There are also indicators which show if the
hyperbolic and inverse function switches are set, and which numerical mode
is currently in operation. If an operation needing more than one numerical
input is partially complete, the operation is also displayed in this window
as a reminder.
.LP
On startup,
.B calctool
will use several X resources. These are listed in detail in the resources
section of these manual pages.
.LP
If you press MENU in the
.B calctool
window, and you aren't over a calculator key which has a menu associated
with it, then a floating menu will appear, from which you can bring up a
property sheet. Hitting the
.I Props
function key has the same effect.
.LP
From this property sheet, you can modify several properties of the
calculator. Each calculator button can have either a 2D or a 3D look, the
keys can be in either monochrome or color (assuming you are using a color
screen), and the buttons can be set to give either a "left-handed" or a
"right-handed" appearance.
.LP
Context sensitive help is also available. Position the mouse cursor over the
item you need help with, and press the
.I Help
key.  A popup will be displayed giving detailed information on this facility.
.LP
On startup,
.B calctool
will look for a
.B .calctoolrc
file in the users' home directory. This file allows the user to define personal
constant and function definitions, plus setup the initial values for the
ten memory registers. It then looks for a
.B .calctoolrc
file in the current directory, and if present, uses the contents of this file
in place of any previously defined values.
.LP
With the
.B .calctoolrc
file, there are currently four valid record types. These are comments,
constant and function definitions and initial memory register values.
.LP
Lines starting with a '#' are treated as comments and ignored.
.LP
Lines starting with 'c' or 'C' in the first column are definitions for
constants. The cC is followed by a digit in the range 0-9, then a space.
This is followed by a number in fixed or scientific notation. Following
this is an optional comment, which if found, will be used in the popup
menu for the constants. If the comment is present, then there must be at
least one space between this and the preceding number.
.LP
Lines starting with 'f' or 'F' in the first column are definitions
for functions. The fF is followed by a digit in the range 0-9, then a
space. This is followed by a function definition. Following this is an
optional comment, which if found, will be used in the popup menu for the
functions. If the comment is present, then there must be at least one
space between this and the preceding function definition.
.LP
Lines starting with 'r' or 'R' in the first column are definitions
for the initial contents of the memory registers. The rR is followed
by a digit in the range 0-9, then a space. This is followed by a number
in fixed or scientific notation. The rest of the line is ignored.
.LP
All other lines are ignored. There should be no embedded spaces in the
function definitions. Whenever a backslash is found, this and the following
character signify a control character, for example \\g would be ASCII 7.

.SH CALCULATOR BUTTONS
.PD
.LP
This section describes the calculator keys present in the main
.B calctool
window. Apart from this basic mode,
.B calctool
has three other modes, and the keys associated each each of these modes are
described in separate sections below.
.LP
Keyboard equivalents appear in the square brackets. Note that '^' followed
by a letter indicates that the Control key and this key should be pressed
together.
.SS "Numerical Keys [ 0-9 a-f . = <Return> ]."
.LP
Enter a digit (decimal digits 0-9 or hexadecimal digits A-F) into the display.
The '.' character acts as the numeric point, and '=' (or Return) is used to
complete numerical entry.
.LP
Upto forty digits may be entered.
.SS "Arithmetical Operations [ + - x * / ]."
.LP
Perform an arithmetical operation using the previous entry and the next entry
as operands. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are denoted by
the characters '+', '-', 'x' and '/' respectively ('*' is also synonymous with
multiplication).
.SS Number Manipulation Operators.
.LP
.PD 0
.IP "\fBInt	[ ^i ]\fP" 18
Return the integer portion of the current entry.
.IP "\fBFrac	[ ^f ]\fP" 18

.IP "\fBSqrt	[ s ]\fP" 18
Perform a square root operation on the current entry.
.IP "\fBAsc	[ ^a ]\fP" 18
If Asc is selected with the mouse, then a separate window is displayed
which allows you to enter any character. The ASCII value of this character
is then displayed in the current base. If this option is selected via the
keyboard, then you don't get a special window displayed.
.PD
.SS Menu Operations.
.LP
Each of these operations has a popup menu associated with it. This menu can
be displayed using the MENU mouse button, and a selection made. You can
select the default item from the menu using the SELECT mouse button.
.LP
It is also possible to use just the keyboard to achieve the same results.
The first keyboard value selects the menu operation; the second keyboard
character selects the new value for this operation. Unlike the menu facility
available with the mouse, there is no visual feedback on what choices are
available to you, so the user has to know what item they wish to select.
.PD 0
.IP "\fBBase	[ B ]\fP" 18
Change the base that calculations are displayed in. The available choices are
binary [ b ], octal [ o ], decimal [ d ] and hexadecimal [\ h\ ]. Digits that
are inappropriate for a particular base selection are greyed out in the main
.B calctool
window.
.IP "\fBDisp	[ D ]\fP" 18
Change the numerical display mode. The choices are engineering [\ e\ ], fixed
point [ f ], and scientific [ s ] notation. 
.IP "\fBMode	[ M ]\fP" 18
Change the calculator mode. By default,
.B calctool
is in basic mode, and just the keys on the main
.B calctool
window are visible. There are also three other modes; financial [ f ],
logical [ l ] and scientific [ s ]. Selection of one of these modes will
display an extra window with more keys. These special operations are
described in more detail in the sections below.
.IP "\fBAcc	[ A ]\fP" 18
Set the display accuracy. Between 0 and 9 [ 0-9 ] significant digits can be
displayed.
.IP "\fBCon	[ # ]\fP" 18
Retrieve and display a constant value. There are ten constant values [ 0-9 ],
and each one has a default value which can be overridden by entries in the
users
.B .calctoolrc
file. The ten default values are:

Retrieve memory register value. There are ten memory registers [\ 0-9\ ].
.IP "\fBSto	[ S ]\fP" 18
Store value in memory register. There are ten memory registers [\ 0-9\ ].
The register number may be preceded by an arithmetic operation (addition,
subtraction, multiplication or division), in which case the specified
operation is carried out between the displayed entry and the value currently
in the selected memory register, and the result is placed in the memory
register.
.IP "\fBExch	[ X ]\fP" 18
Exchange the current display with the contents of a memory register. There
are ten memory registers [ 0-9 ].
.SS Other Operations.
.LP
.IP "\fBClr	[ Delete ]\fP" 18
Clear the calculator display.
.IP "\fBBsp	[ Back Space ]\fP" 18
Remove the rightmost character of the current entry, and recalculate the
displayed value.
.IP "\fB( and )	[ ( and ) ]\fP" 18
Parentheses. Allow precedence with arithmetic calculations. Note that
parentheses can be nested to any level, and
.B calctool
provides a visual feedback of what is being typed in, in the calculator
display. The calculation doesn't take place until the last parenthesis is
matched, then the display is updated with the new result.
.IP "\fBExp	[ E ]\fP" 18
This is used to allow numbers to be entered in scientific notation. The
mantissa should be initially entered, then the Exp key selected. The exponent
is then entered. If no numerical input had occurred when the Exp key was
selected, then a mantissa of 1.0 is assumed.
.IP "\fBKeys	[ k ]\fP" 18
Toggle the labels on the
.B calctool
buttons between the mouse and keyboard equivalents.
.IP "\fBMem	[ m ]\fP" 18
Display the window with the ten memory register values. These values are
displayed in the current base to the current degree of accuracy using the
current numerical display notation.
.IP "\fBQuit	[ q or Q ]\fP" 18
Exit without user verification.

Set the current trigonometrical base. This can be in degrees [ d ],
grads [ g ] or radians [ r ]. This key also has a popup menu associated
with it.
.IP "\fBHyp	[ h ]\fP" 18
Toggle the hyperbolic function indicator. This switch affects the type of
sine, cosine and tangent trigonometric functions performed.
.IP "\fBInv	[ i ]\fP" 18
Toggle the inverse function indicator. This switch affects the type of sine,
cosine and tangent trigonometric functions performed.
.IP "\fBe^x	[ { ]\fP" 18
Returns e raised to the power of the current entry.
.IP "\fB10^x	[ } ]\fP" 18
Returns 10 raised to the power of the current entry.
.IP "\fBy^x	[ y ]\fP" 18
Take the last entry and raise it to the power of the next entry.
.IP "\fBx!	[ ! ]\fP" 18
Return the factorial of the current entry. Note that the factorial function
is only valid for positive integers.
.IP "\fBCos	[ ^c ]\fP" 18
Return the trigonometric cosine, arc cosine, hyperbolic cosine or inverse
hyperbolic cosine of the current display, depending upon the current
settings of the hyperbolic and inverse function switches. The result is
displayed in the current trigonometric units (degrees, radians or grads).
