:Metoo:$OPENWINHOME/bin/helpopen handbooks/mail.handbook
Include me when I "Reply To All" (metoo)

With this option set, you will receive a copy
of the reply when you "Reply To All."

Setting the "metoo" option renders ineffective
the "allnet" option.

Please see the help for "Ignore host name in
address (allnet)." 

:Allnet:$OPENWINHOME/bin/helpopen handbooks/mail.handbook
Ignore host name in address (allnet)

This option affects how addresses are handled in
the To and Cc fields of the Compose window when
you "Reply To All." Setting "allnet" has no
effect if "metoo" has been set.

With "allnet" set and "metoo" not set, Mail Tool
treats any address containing your login as your
address.  

If both "metoo" and "allnet" are not set, then
only the address of type "login@machine" is
treated as your address.

:Ttlock:$OPENWINHOME/bin/helpopen handbooks/mail.handbook
Use network aware mail file locking

Use this option if you run Mail Tool from more 
than one machine at once or if you access your 
mail files over the network.

This option uses tooltalk to coordinate the 
Mail Tools.

Mail Tool can only change this option when first
opening a mail file.

If you change this option when a mail file is open,
you have these options:

	Save the current mail file and reopen it, 
	making the new locking technique take 
	effect immediately.

	Continue editing the current mail file.
	The new locking technique takes effect
	the next time you open a mail file.

	Abort the Apply operation and return to 
	editing the property window.
