.SH NAME
binder \- modify deskset bindings database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B binder
[
.BR \-user \ | -system \ | -network
]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This command is available with the OpenWindows 
environment.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B binder
is an OpenWindows XView tool that
allows the user to bind applications, icons, colors, print methods,
and open methods to files.  A binding is a logical connection between
file types and
elements such as file types, applications to be invoked when a file
is opened, print scripts, or icons that the File Manager, Print Tool,
Mail Tool, and other DeskSet applications use to display and operate on files.
.LP
The binder displays all the bindings stored in three different
Classing Engine databases:  a
network database, a system database, and a private user database.
These
are the Classing Engine databases used by all applications in the DeskSet
Environment to determine how to display, print, and open any file.
You cannot modify a system or network binding unless you are root.
.LP
The three Classing Engine databases are located in:
.BR $OPENWINHOME/lib/cetables/cetables ,
.br
.BR /etc/cetables/cetables ,
and
.br
.BR $HOME/.cetables/cetables ,
respectively.
.br
By doing this, users may customize their working
environment without affecting others.
