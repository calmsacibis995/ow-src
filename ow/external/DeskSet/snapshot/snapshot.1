.SH DESCRIPTION

workstation screens into a raster file. The user may choose to take a picture

for example, displaying color images on a monochrome screen. The image is
appropriately dithered before it is displayed. Compressed images will be
unpacked and loaded automatically.

Images can be saved to disk in Sun rasterfile format, or printed on a
PostScript printer. There are various printer options (see below).
