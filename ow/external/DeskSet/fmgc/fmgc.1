.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B fmgc 
is a program to garbage collect a users ~/.fm directory hierarchy. This
hierarchy of files is created by the
.B filemgr
program to store information on directories visited by the user (including the
position of each file icon if the user moves a file). It is possible that over
time, the size of this file hierarchy could grow considerably. This program
is used to help the user maintain this. It will remove directory information
relating to the oldest used directories until a limit is reached.
.PP
It uses information stored in the users ~/.desksetdefaults file to generate
a list of directories to be excluded from this pruning. This list will contain
the directories for the users saved window positions plus any directories on
the users goto list. It is also possible to include additional directories on
the
.B fmgc
command line.
