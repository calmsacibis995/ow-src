.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These macros are designed to facilitate conversion between
integer and floating-point
.SM PCM
audio data.
.LP
.BR audio_c2d(\|) ,
.BR audio_s2d(\|) ,
and
.B audio_l2d(\|)
convert 8, 16, and 32 bit
.SM PCM
signed integers to floating-point values that range between \-1. and +1.
In order to preserve symmetry around 0, the singular value represented by
the most negative integer (that is, \-128, \-32768, \-2147483648) is clipped
to \-1.
.LP
.BR audio_d2c(\|) ,
.BR audio_d2s(\|) ,
and
.B audio_d2l(\|)
convert floating-point data to
.SM PCM
signed integers of 8, 16, or 32 bit precision, respectively.
Floating-point values outside the range of \(+-1. are clipped at
full range in the appropriate precision.

.LP
The manual pages, header files, and object library associated with
.B /usr/demo/SOUND/libaudio.a
are furnished on an
.I as is
basis as a preliminary interface to several
useful audio data-processing capabilities.  A future release of the
operating system may redefine the syntax or semantics of some of the
functions described herein.
