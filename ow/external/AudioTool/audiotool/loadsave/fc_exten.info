The Format selector allows you to specify the
audio data format to be used in saving the data.
This may be used to rewrite a file in a different
format.  Note that the Save operation will take
somewhat longer when a data format transformation
is specified.

Select "Current Format" to store the data without
changing its format.  Select "New Format..." to
bring up the Audio Format configuration panel.

The File Size displayed below indicates the amount
of storage required to save the current file using
the specified audio format and compression.
#
:fc_exten-compress_menu
The Compress selector allows you to choose an
audio compression method to be used in saving the
data.  When data is stored using a compressed data
format, there will be some loss of sound quality.
Note that the Save operation will take somewhat
longer when a data compression is specified.

The Compression options are:

None:
    Store the data in the format specified in
    the Format field.

4-bit G.721 ADPCM:
    Store the data using the CCITT 4-bit ADPCM
    compression algorithm.

3-bit G.723 ADPCM:
    Store the data using the CCITT 3-bit ADPCM
    compression algorithm.  This compression is
    usually acceptable for voice data, but may
    introduce distortion in music.

File Size is updated to indicate the amount of
storage required to save the current file using
the specified audio format and compression.
