:config-Tool_config_control
Audio Tool Properties Window

This panel contains controls for the configurable
Audio Tool properties.  Help is available for the
individual controls.
#
:config-Autoplay_set
If this option is selected, Audio Tool will begin
playing a file as soon as it is loaded.

#
:config-AutoSelect_set
If this option is selected, Audio Tool will begin
playing the selected audio region immediately
after a selection is made.

#
:config-Confirm_clear_set
If this option is selected, pop-up confirmers will
be displayed before unsaved data is discarded
permanently (i.e., File->New... or File->Open...
operations, or drag'n'drop to the tool
drop-site).

Since the Edit->Clear operation is undoable, this
function does not require a confirmation.
#
:config-SilenceDetect_check
If this option is selected, the display of sound
and silence segments is enabled.

When Silence Detection is enabled, regions of
silence are displayed as horizontal lines and
regions of sound are displayed as boxes.  These
segments can be useful in locating particular
phrases or regions of voice data.

Silence detection requires extra time to
calculate, and can be disabled if this overhead is
undesirable.  When Silence Detection is disabled,
the entire file is represented as a single box.

Note that silence detection is always disabled
when the audio data is sampled faster than 8 khz.
#
:config-SilenceDetect_slider
The Silence Threshold slider controls the silence
threshold -- adjust the threshold to control the
amount of time that silence must persist before a
silence segment is displayed.

Drag the slider to the left to increase the
sensitivity to short pauses. (This should increase
the number of sound and silence segments.)

Drag the slider to the right to decrease the
sensitivity. (This should decrease the number of
segments.)

To disable silence detection entirely, clear the
Silence Detection checkbox.

Please see the help for Silence Detection.
#
:config-tempdir
The Temp file directory specifies a location in
which to store audio data temporarily.  This
directory is used, for example, when recording new
audio data.  The temporary space is released when
the file has been saved to permanent storage.

This field should identify a writeable directory
on a filesystem that has plenty of free space
available.
#
:config-Apply_button
Apply changes and save the current configuration
to the audio properties file ($HOME/.audiorc).
#
:config-Reset_button
Reset panel items to their previous settings
(i.e., the values that were set at the last
"Apply").
