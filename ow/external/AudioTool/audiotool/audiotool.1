.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAudio Tool\fP is an OpenWindows DeskSet application for recording,
playing, and simple editing of audio data.
.SS Sound Segment Display
.LP
\fBAudio Tool\fP analyzes sound data to distinguish between sound segments
and silence segments.
Segments of sounds are displayed as boxes; segments of silence are displayed as
lines connecting these boxes.  This type of display can be useful for
scanning and editing voice data, since pauses often indicate breaks between
sentences or key phrases.  Data may be selected, using the mouse, in a manner
similar to text selections.  Double-clicking on a sound or silence segment
selects the entire segment.  The \fBCut\fP, \fBCopy\fP, and \fBPaste\fP
operations also work on selected data.
.LP
A triangular graphic indicator, called the \fIposition pointer\fP,
marks the current play position.  When you select a segment of audio data,
the position pointer is constrained to remain within the selected segment.
The position pointer also denotes the point in a segment where \fBRecord\fP
and \fBPaste\fP operations will insert data.
.SS Control Panel
.TP
.B "Play/Stop"
Clicking this button starts playing audio data at the current position.
Playing will stop automatically at the end of the data
or at the end of the currently selected segment, whichever comes first.
If the position pointer is at the end of the data (or selection) when 
.B Play
is pressed, it jumps back to the beginning of the data before starting to play.
.sp
While data is playing, this button becomes a \fBStop\fP
button.  Audio output may be stopped and restarted at will.
.TP
.B "Rewind/Fast-Forward"
Clicking either of these buttons causes the position pointer to jump
backward or forward to the next sound segment boundary. If you press and hold
one of these buttons,
playing will begin/proceed at an accelerated rate in the designated
direction. Releasing the button returns the tool to its previous state.
.TP
.B "Record/Stop"
Clicking this button starts the recording of data
from the audio input port.
The recorded data is inserted at the position pointer's position.
If audio data is currently selected, it is replaced by the new recording.
While recording is in progress, this button becomes a \fBStop\fP button.
.SS "File Browser Panel"
.LP
Selecting \fBOpen...\fP, \fBSave As...\fP, or \fBInclude...\fP from the
\fBFile\fP menu will bring up the \fBFile Browser Panel\fP.
The \fBDirectory\fP field displays the pathname of the current directory.
.LP
The scrolling list contains a list of directories or audio files
in the displayed directory. Double-click SELECT on the name of a directory to
change to that directory. Double-click SELECT on the name of an audio file
to perform the current operation (Load, Save, or Include) on the selected
file. You can also type file names or directories into the \fBName\fP
field.
.LP
When \fBSave As...\fP
is selected from the File menu, the File Browser displays an additional
choice item, which enables you to select the file format. The choices are
\fBUncompressed\fP (8-bit 8 kHz, \(*m-law), or \fBCompressed\fP
(4-bit G.721 ADPCM). The compressed format takes up half the disk space but
can take somewhat longer to load and save.
.SS "Volume Panels"
.LP
Selecting \fBPlay...\fP  or \fBRecord...\fP  from the \fBVolume\fP
menu will invoke the \fBAudio Control\fP
application to display volume control panels for the audio device.
Refer to the
.BR audiocontrol (1)
manual page for further details.
