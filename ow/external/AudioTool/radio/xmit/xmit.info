:XmitControlPanel
The Radio Free Ethernet transmitter program broadcasts audio data over the network.  For an overview of Radio Free Ethernet, please refer to the radio(6) manual page.
# 
:StatusMessage
The current state of the Radio Free Ethernet transmitter is displayed in this status field.
# 
:PowerButton
The Power button toggles the radio transmitter
off and on.  While the transmitter is turned on, audio data is broadcast from your machine over the network.  A station name must be set before the transmitter can be enabled.
# 
:StationButton
The Station item brings up a menu containing a list of the currently configured broadcast stations.  Selecting a station from this list prepares the transmitter to begin broadcasting, using the station name as an identifying string.  The Edit... menu item brings up a panel that may be used to edit the broadcast station list and parameters.
# 
:StationButtonText
The Station item brings up a menu containing a list of the currently configured broadcast stations.  Selecting a station from this list prepares the transmitter to begin broadcasting, using the station name as an identifying string.  The Edit... menu item brings up a panel that may be used to edit the broadcast station list and parameters.
# 
:VolumeControl
The Input Volume slider may be used to manualy adjust the audio input gain level.  It is automatically adjusted when Auto Volume Adjust is enabled.
# 
:AgcControl
Auto Volume Adjust enables an automatic gain control (AGC) algorithm that monitors the audio input volume and adjusts it when the data is too soft or too loud.  The Input Volume slider will move when the recording gain is adjusted.
# 
:StationControlPanel
For information on particular broadcast parameters, position the mouse over the item in question and press the Help key.
# 
:StationList
This is a list of the currently configured broadcast stations.  Selecting an entry in this list will update the panel to display the station parameters.  Selected stations may be changed or deleted.
# 
:StationItem
The Station item is used to enter a station name (up to four characters).  The station name may be thought of as the radio station call letters, and is used to identify radio broadcast packets.
# 
:SignonItem
The Sign-On File item specifies the an audio file that will be broadcast when the transmitter is initially powered on.  Once the Sign-On File has been completely broadcast, the transmitter switches to the Audio Input file or device.
# 
:InputItem
The Audio Input item specifies the source of audio data for normal station broadcasting.  An audio file or device name may be specified.  The default setting (/dev/audio) enables data to be read from the workstation microphone input and broadcast over the network.
# 
:SignoffItem
The Sign-Off File item specifies the an audio file that will be broadcast when the transmitter is powered off.
# 
:ShutoffControl
Auto-Shutoff determines the action to be taken when an audio broadcast has been silent for a full minute.  When enabled, the station will automatically sign off.  This feature allows the transmitter to shut down at the end of a CD or tape input.
# 
:FormatControl
The Audio Format item selects the data format for audio packets transmitted over the network.  The Uncompressed audio format is 8000 bytes/sec, while the Compressed audio format is 4000 bytes/sec.  The Audio Format setting applies only to audio input from the audio device (/dev/audio).
# 
:AddressItem
The Multicast Addr item may be used to specify a particular broadcast address.  If a hostname is supplied, it must refer to an entry in the hosts table that contains a multicast address (you cannot, for instance, broadcast to a particular machine by name).  This item is enabled only when the Broadcast Band is set to `as indicated'.
# 
:HopcountItem
The Multicast Hops item is used to specify the number of network gateways over which a broadcast may be relayed.  A hopcount of 1 ensures that the broadcast will not go beyond the local subnet.

This value is ignored if the Multicast Addr field is set to BROADCAST, as UDP Broadcast packets are not relayed over gateways.
# 
:AddButton
The Add button adds a station to the station list with the current parameter settings.  If the named station is already in the list, its parameters are updated.  A station name of up to four letters must be supplied in the Station: item.

The Add button also causes the current program parameters to be written out to the initialization file ($HOME/.radiorc).
# 
:ChangeButton
The Change button updates the selected station with the current parameter settings.  If no station is selected, the named station is added or updated.  Changes to the parameters for a station that is currently broadcasting will not take effect until the transmitter is turned off.

The Change button also causes the current program parameters to be written out to the initialization file ($HOME/.radiorc).
# 
:DeleteButton
The Delete button removes the selected station from the station list.  It also causes the current program parameters to be written out to the initialization file ($HOME/.radiorc).
# 
:PlusMinusButton
The +/- button toggles between the default and advanced modes of the Station Configuration panel.
