.SH SYNOPSIS
.B audiocontrol
[
.B \-d
.I device

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B "Audio Control"
is an OpenWindows DeskSet application that controls and configures the
workstation audio device.
By default,
.B "Audio Control"
operates on
.BR /dev/audio ,
though the
.SB AUDIODEV
environment variable can be used to override this default.
An alternate audio device name may be entered on the command line using the
.B \-d
option.
.LP
Operations performed by the
.B "Audio Control"
control panel affect all audio programs using the specified device;
for instance, adjusting the
.I Play Volume
instantly changes the output gain, regardless of which program is playing
audio data.  Further,
.B "Audio Control"
detects audio state changes made by other programs,
and updates its display accordingly, so that it stays synchronized
with the current device configuration.
.LP
In addition to command line initiation,
.B "Audio Control"
may be started via the ToolTalk Media Exchange Protocol.
.BR "Audio Tool" ,
for instance, invokes
.B "Audio Control"
for volume and audio port control.
.LP
.B "Audio Control"
demonstrates an important principle involved in the integration of
audio in the desktop environment: by enabling global control of important
audio characteristics, it is not necessary for every application to
provide an interface for these parameters.  For instance, since the
audio output can be set from the control panel, it is not strictly
necessary that output applications contain output port controls themselves.
However, such applications may detect that the audio output port has been
changed, and take appropriate action.
.SH "Play Control Panel"
.IP "Output Port"
This selector redirects audio output.  There is a selector for each
available output port provided by your hardware configuration.
Normally, the available output ports include
.I Speaker
and
.IR Headphone .
Some systems also support
.IR "Line Out" .
If a control is present but inactivated (greyed-out), this indicates
that the corresponding port is supported, but is unavailable; this
can happen, for instance, when the audio device detects that a
headset has not been plugged into the headphone jack.
Note that some devices allow multiple output ports to be enabled simultaneously.
.IP "Play Volume"
This slider adjusts the output volume.
Volume levels between 0 and 100 may be selected, where 0 represents
infinite attenuation and 100 is maximum gain.
.IP "Play Balance"
This slider adjusts the left/right balance.  This control does not appear
if the audio device does not support stereo balance control.
.IP "Mute"
This button is used to enable and disable audio output muting.
Note that muting output has no effect on audio input recording.
.IP "Record..."
This button brings up the Record Control Panel.
.SH "Record Control Panel"
.IP "Input Port"
This control selects the audio input port.  There is a selector for each
available input port provided by your hardware configuration.
On many systems, only the
.I Microphone
port is available,
although some systems also support
.IR "Line In" .
If a control is present but inactivated (greyed-out), this indicates
that the corresponding port is supported, but is unavailable; this
can happen, for instance, when the audio device detects that a
microphone has not been plugged into the microphone input jack.
In general, input ports are mutually exclusive; that is, audio signals
on multiple inputs are not mixed.
.IP "Record Volume"
This slider adjusts the recording volume level in the range 0 to 100.
.IP "Record Balance"
This slider adjusts the left/right balance.  This control does not appear
if the audio device does not support stereo balance control.
.IP "Auto-Adjust"
Clicking this button starts an automatic recording level adjustment
procedure.  The input data is scanned to determine its loudness and
the record volume is adjusted to achieve an optimal signal level.
Once the input signal appears to be properly calibrated for several seconds,
the panel will reset to a normal operating state.  All input audio data
is discarded during the automatic adjustment procedure.
.IP
A display gauge indicates the overall input level.  If you have connected
a microphone to the audio input jack, then you may adjust the recording
level for your speaking voice by pressing the
.I "Auto-Adjust"
button and then speaking normally into the microphone until the adjustment
process is finished.  If you have connected a CD-player or other audio source,
you can adjust the
.I "Monitor Volume"
to hear the audio data that is being used to calibrate the recording level.
.IP "Monitor Volume"
This slider adjusts the monitor gain level in the range 0 to 100.
Monitor gain controls the amount of audio input signal that is
fed through to the output port.  For instance, if an audio source
(such as a radio or CD-player) is connected directly to the input port,
the input signal may be monitored through the selected output port
by adjusting this slider. Note that there may be
audible feedback (a high-pitched whine) if a microphone is connected to 
the workstation and the monitor volume is set greater than zero.
.SH "Audio Device Status Panel"
.LP
.B "Audio Control"
includes an audio status panel that shows the current state
of the audio device.  This panel can be useful for debugging
audio applications and determining whether applications are locking
out the audio device by holding it open.
Selecting ``Status...'' from the panel menu or pressing the
.SB PROPS
(L3) key brings up the status panel.
.IP "Update"
When the
.I Update
selector is set to
.IR "Status Change" ,
the audio device status is updated only when a
.SB SIGPOLL
signal is delivered to
.B "Audio Control"
(see
.BR audio (7)).
Because of this, the
.I Active
and 
.I Samples
indicators are not necessarily kept up-to-date.
This mode is useful for application debugging in order to see exactly
when audio device status changes are being reported.
When the
.I Continuous
mode is selected, the status is continually updated.
