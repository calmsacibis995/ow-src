:recordctl-AutoAdjustButton
The Auto-Adjust feature attempts to set the audio
record volume level to a value that ensures a
sufficient signal strength without audio
distortion.

Press the Auto-Adjust button to begin automatic
adjustment of the record volume level.  Speak
clearly into your microphone using your normal
speaking voice (try reading this text message, if
that helps).

The record volume adjustment will continue until a
reasonable input level has been maintained for 5
seconds.  Be sure to continue speaking until the
adaptation is complete.

If you have directly connected an audio source
(such as a CD player) to the input port, be sure
to play a loud section while the Auto-Adjust
operation is in progress.  Adjust the Monitor
Volume slider to be able to hear a directly
connected audio source before and during the
Auto-Adjust.

The Record Volume slider may be adjusted manually
at any time during the Auto-Adjust operation.
#

without actually recording it.

Be careful not to turn the monitor volume up too
quickly if your input source is a microphone, as
this may cause feedback.
