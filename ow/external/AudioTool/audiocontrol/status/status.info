#
:status-PlayStatusCanvas
The Play Status panel displays the current state
of the audio device output stream.

If Update is set to "Status Change", the `Active'
and `Samples' fields are only updated when other
audio device status changes.

If Update is set to "Continuous", then the
`Active' and `Samples' fields are updated several
times per second.

Spot Help is available for each status indicator.
For additional information on audio device state,
please refer to the audio(7) manual page.
#

#
:status-Popen_flag
Play Status `Open' is set whenever a process has
opened the audio device with write access.  Since
the audio driver enforces exclusive use of the
device, processes that want to perform audio
output must wait until the audio device is closed
before they can gain access to the device.

If a process cannot open the audio device for
writing, the Play Status `Open' flag can help
identify some other process that is holding the
device open.
#
:status-Ppaused_flag
Play Status `Paused' indicates that output to the
audio device is temporarily suspended.
#
:status-Pactive_flag
Play Status `Active' is set while output to the
audio device is in progress.  Changes to this
indicator are not signalled by a Status Change.
Therefore, this indicator may be inconsistent with
the actual device state unless Update is set to
`Continuous'.
#
:status-Perror_flag
Play Status `Underflow' is set when an audio
application has failed to provide the audio device
with data in a timely manner.  It may indicate
that the application cannot keep up with the
demands of supplying audio data at the current
sample rate.
#
:status-Pwaiting_flag
Play Status `Open-Waiting' indicates that a
process is trying to open the audio device to play
audio data, but must wait for the current audio
output process to relinquish the device.
#
:status-Peof_label
Play Status `EOF Count' displays the number of
end-of-file marks that have been processed by the
audio device driver.  End-of-file marks are used
by applications for synchronization purposes.
#
:status-Peof_value
Play Status `EOF Count' displays the number of
end-of-file marks that have been processed by the
audio device driver.  End-of-file marks are used
by applications for synchronization purposes.
#
:status-Psam_label
Play Status `Samples' indicates the number of
audio samples that have been processed by the
audio device.  This value is reset every time the
device is closed and may be reset at any time by
audio applications.

Most changes to this indicator are not signalled
by a Status Change.  Therefore, this indicator may
be inconsistent with the actual device state
unless Update is set to `Continuous'.
#
:status-Psam_value
Play Status `Samples' indicates the number of
audio samples that have been processed by the
audio device.  This value is reset every time the
device is closed and may be reset at any time by
audio applications.

Most changes to this indicator are not signalled
by a Status Change.  Therefore, this indicator may
be inconsistent with the actual device state
unless Update is set to `Continuous'.
#
:status-Pbuf_label
Play Status `Granularity' indicates the expected
accuracy of the Play Status `Samples' counter.

If Play Status `Granularity' is not displayed,
this indicates that the audio device driver does
not yet support this option.
#
:status-Pbuf_value
Play Status `Granularity' indicates the expected
accuracy of the Play Status `Samples' counter.

If Play Status `Granularity' is not displayed,
this indicates that the audio device driver does
not yet support this option.
#
:status-Pencode_label
Play Status `Encoding' indicates the audio data
stream sample format.  8-bit u-law and A-law
encodings are used for most voice-quality
applications.  16-bit linear encoding is used for
high-quality recording.
#
:status-Pencode_value

#
:status-Prate_value
Play Status `Sample Rate' indicates the number of
digitized audio samples per second.
#
:status-Pchan_label
Play Status `Channels' indicates the number of
audio channels interleaved in the data stream.  If
the data stream has a single channel, this
indicator will display 'mono'.  If the data stream
has two channels, this indicator will display
'stereo'.
#
:status-Pchan_value
Play Status `Channels' indicates the number of
audio channels interleaved in the data stream.  If
the data stream has a single channel, this
indicator will display 'mono'.  If the data stream
has two channels, this indicator will display
'stereo'.
#
:status-RecordStatusCanvas
The Record Status panel displays the current state
of the audio device input stream.

If Update is set to "Status Change", the `Active'
and `Samples' fields are only updated when other
audio device status changes.

If Update is set to "Continuous", then the
`Active' and `Samples' fields are updated several
times per second.

#
:status-Ropen_flag
Record Status `Open' is set whenever a process has
opened the audio device with read access.  Since
the audio driver enforces exclusive use of the
device, processes that want to record audio input
must wait until the audio device is closed before
they can gain access to the device.

If a process cannot open the audio device for
reading, the Record Status `Open' flag can help
identify some other process that is holding the
device open.
#
:status-Rpaused_flag
Record Status `Paused' indicates that input from
the audio device is temporarily suspended.
#
:status-Ractive_flag
Record Status `Active' is set while input from the
audio device is in progress.  Changes to this
indicator are not signalled by a Status Change.
Therefore, this indicator may be inconsistent with
the actual device state unless Update is set to
`Continuous'.
#
:status-Rerror_flag
The Record Status `Overflow' indicator is set when
an audio application has failed to read audio data
from the system buffers at a sufficient rate.  It
usually indicates that the recording in progress
will have one or more audio drop-outs.
#
:status-Rwaiting_flag
Record Status `Open-Waiting' indicates that a
process is trying to open the audio device to
record audio data, but must wait for the current
audio input process to relinquish the device.
#
:status-Rsam_label
Record Status `Samples' indicates the number of
audio samples that have been input by the audio
device.  This value is reset every time the device

by a Status Change.  Therefore, this indicator may
be inconsistent with the actual device state
unless Update is set to `Continuous'.

by a Status Change.  Therefore, this indicator may
be inconsistent with the actual device state
unless Update is set to `Continuous'.
#
:status-Rbuf_label
Input Delay gives an indication of the amount of
input data that is buffered by the audio driver
during a record operation.  This value represents
the minimum delay that can be expected between
audio input events and any real-time display or
output of the data being recorded.

If Input Delay is not displayed, this indicates
that the audio device driver does not yet support
this option.
